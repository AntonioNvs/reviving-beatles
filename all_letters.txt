A Case Of The Blues

Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Seventh church is on his head its on-headed glue
Sales in the morning, it's a case of the blues oh oh oh

Albino-coloured glasses shooting knock-kneed shoes
Second pair of dockers sang inside of a hood
This is the morning, a case of the blues
This is the morning, it's a case of the blues
This is the morning, it's a case of the blues

Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Sammy tries to bargain with a celephant jew
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues

Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Driving pair of lincoln sandals, sham leather shoe
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues

Albino-coloured glasses looking back-kneed shoes
Come together, sell a gender, it's pleasant to choose
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
So watch it
She took off
[...]
So long

Albino-coloured glasses with a knock-kneed shoe
Merry chives departed down the celephant jew
Everyone knows it's a case of the blues
Albino-coloured glasses wearing knock-kneed shoes
Alabaster primrose, i'm sad and i'm blue
And everyone knows it's a case of the blues


A Day In The Life

I read the news today, oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords

I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had a look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today, oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on


A Hard Day's Night

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
You make me feel alright

You know I work all day
To get your money to buy your things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
You make me feel alright

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
You make me feel alright

You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright


A Little Rhyme

Rodney Burke: Now, for the final number John's got a card in his hand
with a little rhyme on it. What is it?

John: It's from the form upper third at Hemmel Homestead, it says:
Dear Geroge, John, Ringo, Paul
Here's hoping that you please us all
A Beaty song on swinging voice
We'll leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab, and really cool
So, brighten up our lives at school
Dig this.

So, here's Paul wissling Clarabella.


A Picture Of You

In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like Jewels on the Crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful Picture of you

On a Streetcar, or in the Caf
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you

It was last Summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An I took a little picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my Heart, my Love and my Life
I didnt know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you

Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you, went my Heart, my Love and my Life
I didnt know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you,
Im left with a picture of, oh yeah
That wonderful picture of you


A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues

Well, if your hands start a-clappin'
And your fingers start a-poppin'
And your feet start a-movin' around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around

You get a shot of rhythm and blues.
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure.
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon!
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
And chills come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do

Get a shot of rhythm and blues

A Taste Of Honey

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

I dream of your
First kiss and then
I feel upon
My lips again

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

Oh, I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
For the honey and you

Yours was the kiss
That awoke my heart
There lingers still
Though we're far apart

That taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter
Than wine

I will return
Yes, I will return
I'll come back
(He'll come back)
For the honey
(For the honey)
And you


Abbey Road Medley

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today (yes, it did)

One two three four five six seven
All good children go to heaven

Here comes the Sun king
Here comes the Sun king
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy
Here comes the Sun king
Quando paramucho mi amore de felice coraz√≥n
Mundo paparazzi mi amore cicce verdi parasol
Questo obrigado tantamucho que canite carousel

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter

Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

Her majesty is a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her majesty is a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I wanna tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a belly full of wine
Her majesty is a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm gonna make her mine
oh, yeah, someday I'm gonna make her mine

Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in a polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
That makes the "News of the World"
Yes you could say she was attractively built

(Oh, listen to that now, eheheh
Oh look out! It's)
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh, yeah

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Oh, yeah
Alright
Are you gonna be in my dreams
Tonight

Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to
The love you make


Across The Universe

Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe

Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on
Across the universe

Thoughts meander like a restless
Wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make
Their way across the universe

Jai guru deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of love
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me

Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on
Across the universe

Jai guru deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva

All Things Must Pass

Sunrise doesn't last all morning,
A cloudburst doesn't last all day.
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning.
It's not always been this grey.

All things must pass,
All things must pass away.

Sunset doesn't last all evening,
A mind can blow those clouds away.
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving.
It has not always been this grey.

All things must pass,
All things must pass away.

All things must pass
None of life's strings can last.
So i must be on my way,
Face another day.

Darkness only stays at nighttime,
In the morning it will fade away.
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time.
It's not always
Will to be this grey.

All things must pass,
All things must pass away.
All things must pass,
All things must pass away.

Almost Grown

Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in dutch
I don't browse around too much

Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown

I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park

Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
She's got to talk about romance

You know I'm still livin' in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all


Almost Home

He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
He had a pair of ol' wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashing 5 below
It was freezing rain and spitting snow
he was curled up behind some garbage cans
i was afraid that he was dead
i gave him a gentle shake
when he opened up his eyes
i said ol' man are you ok?... he said...

I just climed out of a cotton wood tree
i was running from some honey bees
drip drying in the summer breeze
after jumping in the calacoe creek
i was walking down an old dirt road
passed a field of hay that had just been mowed
man i wish you'd just left me alone
cuz i was almost home

and he said i had just coming round the barn
bout time you grabbed my arm
when i heard momma holla
son hurry up
i was close enough from my own nose
to smell fresh cogger on the stove
and i saw daddy loadin' up the truck
game polls on the tail gate
bobbers blowing in the wind
Since July of '55
that's as close as I've been...

(chorus)

I said ol' man you're gonna freeze to death
let me drive you to the mission
he said,


And I Love Her

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her


And Your Bird Can Sing

Tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me

When your prized possessions
Start to wear you down
Look in my direction
I'll be around
I'll be around

When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be around
I'll be around

Tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me


Anna (Go to Him)

Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him (Anna)
Go with him (Anna)

Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him

All of my life
I've been searchin' for a girl
To love me like I love you
But let me tell you now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him (anna)
Go with him (anna)
You can go with him, girl (anna)
Go with him


Another Girl

For I have got
Another girl
Another girl

You're makin' me say that I've got
Nobody but you
And as from today, well, I've got
Somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got
Another girl
Another girl

She's sweeter than all the girls and
I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can
Do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop

For I have got
Another girl
Another girl who will love me 'til the end
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

I don't want to say that I've been
Unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen
Somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got
Another girl
Another girl who will love me 'til the end
Through thick and thin, she will always be my friend

I don't want to say that I've been
Unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen
Somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

For I have got
Another girl
Another girl
Another girl


Any Time At All

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you've gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there, to make you feel right

If you're feeling sorry and sad, I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me in tonight

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there

If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There is nothing I won't do

If you need a shoulder to cry on, I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you

Any time at all
Any time at all

Anybody Else

Somedays I don't
I don't believe that you are mine
Somedays I look
I look at you with eyes that shine

You are my strength
When we're apart
You are my strength
When we're apart

It's no good asking me what time of day it is
No use reminding me, it's just the way it is
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
It's no good asking me, it's just the way it is

Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to know which way to turn

Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)
Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)
Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)
Ev'ry night we fuss and fight
Like me and you know who
(We don't need anybody else)

(We don't need)
(We don't need)

Somedays I cry
I cry for those who live in fear
Somedays I look
Somedays I look into your soul
It's no good asking me what time of day it is

Who won the match or scored the goal
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
How much it cost or what it's worth

Inside each one of us is love
('Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea)
('Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree)
Inside each one of us is love
('Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea)
('Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree)
I guess love is always just
(Good for you)

'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree


Ask Me Why

I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never never never be blue

Now you're mine
My happiness dear makes me cry
And in time
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe
It's happened to me
I can't conceive of anymore misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never never never be blue

Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

I can't believe, it's happened to me
I can't conceive of anymore misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you, you, you


Baby's In Black

Oh dear what can I do,
baby's in black and I'm feelin' blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him
and so she dresses in black
and though he'll never come back
she's dressed in black.

Oh dear what can I do,
baby's in black and I'm feelin' blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?

I think of her
but she thinks only of him
and though it's only a whim
she thinks of him.

Oh how long will it take
till she sees the mistake she has made?

Dear what can I do,
baby's in black and I'm feelin blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?

Oh how long will it take
till she sees the mistake she has made?

Dear what can I do,
baby's in black and I'm feelin blue.
Tell me oh, what can I do?

She thinks of him
and so she dresses in black
and though he'll never come back
she's dressed in black.

Oh dear what can I do,
baby's in black and I'm feelin' blue
Tell me oh, what can I do?


Baby, You're a Rich Man

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you travelled very far?
Far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see, when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man too

You keep all your money in a big brown bag, inside a zoo
What a thing to do

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man too

How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to A natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?

Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man too

You keep all your money in a big brown bag, inside a zoo
What a thing to do

Baby, you're a rich man...

Back In The U.S.S.R.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
All the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S., back in the U.S., back in the U.S.S.R.!

Well these Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my mi-ind!

Oh, Come on!

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Well, these Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the west behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my mi-ind!

Oh, show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

I'm back in the U.S.S.R. Hey!
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R
Oh! Let me tell you, honey!
Hey I'm back!
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
Hey! Sing it with me!
Heeeeeey! Back in the U.S.S.R


Back To Memphis

I've been struggling up here, child, trying to make a living
Everybody wants to take, nobody like giving
I wish I was in Memphis back home there with my Mama
The only clothes I got left that ain't rags is my pajamas
No brotherly love, no help, no danger
Just a great big town full of cold hearted strangers

I went hungry in New York and Chicago was no better
But today, my dear mother wrote and told me in her letter
Son, come back to Memphis and live here with your Mama
You can walk down Beale Street, honey, wearing your pajamas
You know home folks here, we let do just what you want to
And I born you and raised you right here on the corner

I'm going to leave here in the morning and walk down to the station
I've got just enough money to pay my transportation
I'm going back to Memphis, back home with my Mama
If I have to ride that bus barefooted in pajamas
Back home in Memphis, no moaning and groaning
I know everything will be all right in the morning


Bad Boy

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts some gum in little girl's hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every time that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's Laundromat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself


Bad To Me

If you ever leave me
I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me
I'm so in love with you

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad
If you're bad to me

The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad
Don't be bad to me

But I know you won't leave me
'Cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know
You won't be bad to me

So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know that I got my one and only
They'd be glad
You're not bad to me

But I know you won't leave me
'Cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know
You won't be bad to me

So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know that I got my one and only
They'd be glad
You're not bad to me

They'd be glad
You're not bad to me
To me
To me


Badge

I'm thnking about the times you drove in my car
I'm thinking that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinking of the love that you laid on my table.

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid' now he's married to Mabel.

Yes I told you that the life goes up and down
Notice how the wheel goes around
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.

Talking about a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell out cradle.

Beautiful Delilah

Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look from fellas passin' by
Every time you see her she's with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why

The better don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, dressed in the latest style
Swingin' like a pendulum, walkin' down the aisle
Deep romantic eyes, speak so low in miles
Maybe she will settle down and marry after a while

The better don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing you just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, bathin' in the sun
An audience of 17, and notice not a one
Local Casanova who wouldn't be outdone
Let her steal his heart away, break it just for fun

The better don't allow me fool around with you
You are so tantalizing you just can't be trueee


Beautiful Dreamer

Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me,
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;
Sounds of the rude world, heard in the day,
Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd away!
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
List while i woo thee with soft melody;
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
Mermaids are chanting the wild lorelie;
Over the streamlet vapors are borne,
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!


Because

Aah!

Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round, aah

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high, aah

Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue, aah

Aah!


Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight
On trampoline

The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair
What a scene

Over men and horses, hoops and garters
Lastly, through a hog's head of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world

The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday
At Bishop's Gate

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
Don't be late!

Misters K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And, of course, Henry the horse dances the waltz

The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks
Without a sound

And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake
On solid ground

Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Blackbird

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird, fly, blackbird, fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird, fly, blackbird, fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride
You take your car along
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am
'Cos every time you're gonna drive
You find the joint is jammed
Oh Carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day. Aw

Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you
'Cos they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought
I got my eyes on you baby
'Cos you dance so good
Don't let him
Steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Child Of Nature

On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less,
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one nature's children

Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children


Christmas Time (Is Here Again)

O-U-T spells "out"

Christmas time is here again

Ain't been round since you know when

George Harrison speaking. I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you
A very Merry Christmas, listeners everywhere.

This is Ringo Starr and I'd just like to say

Circles

Friends come and friends go
As I go round and round in circles

Love someone change your mind
Decide he was a swine
As you go round and round in circles

He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles

Dislike someone and will not bend
Later they may become your best friend
As life it goes around in circles

He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles

Soul takes on a body with each birth we make our date
With life and death along the road the soul reincarnates
The show goes round and round in circles

When loss and gain and up and down
Becomes the same, then we stop going in circles
Round and round in circles

Crinsk Dee Night

Brian: The next few minutes are in the lap of the gods and hands of the
Beatles.  In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and they...
Paul:  Yes.
Brian: Now they...
John:  Hey, listen.
Paul:  It's all changed now.
John:  It's all changed now.
Brian: Well this is what I'm wondering:
Paul:  We're not doing that. No actors.
John:  All now...
Brian: In those days the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor.  Did you find that?
John:  No, no, no.  These are the good bits in the film, that's certainly the best.
Brian: Yes.
John:  Rubish.
Brian: Was it really?
John:  Even worse.
Brian: Who was worse?
John:  Oh, Paul.
Brian: I see.
Paul:  I think John was rather worse.
John:  No, It was you.
Paul:  Oh, RIngo was very good.
Brian: He was?
Paul:  He's a good lad, yes.
Brian: They say he's a new Charlie Chaplan.
John:  He was born that.
Brian: Do you think this is right?
Paul:  He's a Charlie Chaplan?
John:  Oh yeah, but he's an old one. OK Ring.
Brian: You're beginning to look like it.
Ringo: Alright John!
Brian: Now then.
Ringo: Can you hear me?
Paul:  Can you hear him?
Brian: Not really, I hope not...
Ringo: Hello.
Brian: I hope not.
John:  We brought the flowers, Ring.
Brian: Not allowed to talk.
John:  We brought you the flowers.
Ringo: Oh, good.
John:  And the grapes.
Brian: Yeah.
Ringo: Oh, I like grapes.
John:  He likes grapes.
Brian: Time out, time out.
Paul:  He needs a pause.
John:  Well, then we are then.
Brian: Well, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then.
Paul:  Who?
John:  Who?
Paul:  Who?
Brian: Os Beatles.
John:  Los Beatles?
Paul:  Oh.
Brian: Rediculous, Os Beatles.
John:  [yells something in a foreign language???
Brian: I don't suppose you know the title of you film in Portuguese?
Paul:  No.
John:  No, "Crinsk Dee Night"?
Brian: Could be. Let's hear the number, shall we?
John:  Right!


Cry Baby Cry

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the childrens holiday

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee

Cry baby cry

She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh

Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day
The sun is up, the sky is blue
It's beautiful and so are you
Dear Prudence won't you come out and play?

Dear Wack!

Brian Matthew: Well, despite the fact the next request comes from 132 Perry Road,
Sherwood in Nottingham, it's headed up the pool, and starts: Dear Whack, so John
you take it from there.

John: Dear Whack, Please ask those gorgeos lads--he,he--called the
Beatles--ba ba ba ba boo boo boo--to sing You Really Got A Hold On Me,
for Di, Gus, Vis, and me. Also, for the Beatles themselves, especially
Paul--hu--and everybody that was in the Roy Orbison tour, I am a regular
listener of Pop Go The Beatles, good lad, you're a lad, and please
tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show...

Brian Matthew: Alright, oh, stop with that. Wo, that's plenty. And now, what
are you going to sing for us?

John: You Really Got A Hold On Me, mother.


Devil In Her Heart

She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalize
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh her lips are really thrilling

I'll take my chances
For romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

She's got the devil in her heart
No, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no nay will she deceive

I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt em
She won't desert me
Listen can't you see

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No no nay will she deceive

Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me
She won't desert me

She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no, no, no, no this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No, no nay will she deceive

She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No she's an angel sent to me

Don't Bother Me

Since she's been gone
I want no one
To talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame
It's plain to see

So go away and leave me alone
Don't bother me

I can't believe
That she would leave
Me on my own
It's just not right
Where every night
I'm all alone

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
Please don't come near
Just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home
Till that the day

Don't come around leave me alone
Don't bother me

I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

But till she's here
Please don't come near
Just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home
Till that the day

Don't come around leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me


Don't Ever Change

You never wear a suit of lace,
the powder's not on your face.
You're always wearing jeans
except on sunday.
So please don't ever change,
no don't you ever change.
I kind of like you
just the way you are.
You don't know the latest dance,
but when it's time to make romance
your kisses let me know
you're not a tomboy.
So please don't ever change,
no don't you ever change.
Promise you're always gonna be
as sweet as you are.
I love you when you're happy,
I love you when you're blue.
I love you when you're mad at me,
so how can I get tired of you?
A lots of other girls I've seen,
they know how to treat guys mean.
But you would rather die
than ever hurt me.
So please don't ever change,
no don't you ever change.
Just promise me you're always gonna be
as sweet as you are.
Please don't ever change,
don't you ever change.
Please don't ever change,
don't you ever change.


Don't Let Me Down

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oooh, she does, yes, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
She do me, yes, she does

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last?
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

And from the first time that she really done me
Oooh, she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooh, she done me, she done me good

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down


Don't Pass Me By

I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it, does it mean you don't love me anymore?

I hear the clock a-ticking on the mantelshelf
See the hands a-moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me anymore?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's all right, I'm waiting here just waiting to hear
From you

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Aah, look at all the lonely people
Aah, look at all the lonely people

Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people (aah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

Fallin' In Love Again

Falling in love again, I never wanted to
What am I to do, I can't help it.
Love has always been my game, play it how I may
I was made that way, can't help it.

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame,
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again, I never wanted to
What am I to do, I can't help it.

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame,
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again, I never wanted to
What am I to do, I can't help it.


Fever

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night.

Ev'rybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with the flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn for sooth'

Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn


Fixing a Hole

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
I'm filling in the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go.

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there who
Disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door.

I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go.

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong.
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door.

I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go.
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.


Flying




For No One

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all
Her words of kindness
Linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up
She makes up
She takes her time
And doesn't feel
She has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says
Her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago
She knew someone
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times
When all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years


For You Blue

Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
I love you more than ever girl I do
I want you in the morning girl I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living for ev'ry moment girl for you
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
I love you more than ever girl I do
I really love you


Four Guys

We were four guys
I met Paul, I said do you wanna' join me band, ya know?
Then George joined, and Then Ringo joined
We were just a band that made it very, very big, that's all

Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Band on the run!
Long time ago when we was the band on the run

If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day

(If we ever get out of here)

Back when income tax was all we had
But it's all over now baby blue

Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Band on the run!
Long time ago when we was the band on the run

(Take you away
Take you away)

If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
(If we ever get out of here)

Back when income tax was all we had
And you've really got a hold on me

Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Long time ago when we was the band on the run
Band on the run!
Long time ago when we was the band on the run


Free As a Bird

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a hummingbird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so

Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird

Home, home and dry
Like a hummingbird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird


From a Window

Late yesterday night, I saw a light shine from a window,
and as I looked again, your face came into sight.
I couldn't walk on until you'd gone from your window.
I had to make you mine, I knew you were the one.
Oh, I would be glad just to have a love like that,
oh, I would be true and I'd live my life for you.
So meet me tonight, just where the light shines from a window,
and as I take your hand, say that you'll be mine tonight.
Oh, I would be glad just to have a love like that,
oh, I would be true and I'd live my life for you.
So meet me tonight, just where the light shines from a window,
and as I take your hand, say that you'll be mine tonight.

think.
Alan: Really?
Paul: Yeah, used to love him.
John: What about my book, then?
Paul: Chuck Berry, Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, and, eh, Marvin
Gaye and things. Can't really sing like them, you know. I like
them, though, love them.
John: What about it?

Get Back

Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Jo Jo!

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Jo Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Loretta!

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back, Loretta
Your mommy is waiting for you
Wearing her high hill shoes, and her low neck sweater
Get Back home Loretta

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged


Getting Better

It's getting better all the time!

I used to get mad at my school 
(No, I can't complain!)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool 
(No, I can't complain!)
You're holding me down, turning me round
Filling me up with your rules
(Fool, you fool!)

I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
(It can't get more worse!)
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
(It can't get more worse)
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!
It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can

I admit it's getting better
A little better all the time 
(It can't get more worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!

It's getting better all the time
Better! Better! Better!
Getting so much better all the time


Girl

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool

When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood, she's cool

Girl
Girl, girl

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl
Girl, girl

Ah, girl
Girl, girl


Glad All Over

Glass Onion

I told you about strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast Iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Looking through a glass onion

I told you about the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Sleep pretty darling, do not cry

Good Day Sunshine

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

Then we lie beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she know she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine


Good Morning Good Morning

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town

Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good

Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut


Good Night

Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

Dreams, sweet dreams for me (dreams, sweet)
Dreams, sweet dreams for you (dreams, sweet dreams)

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the Moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight

Dreams, sweet dreams for me (dreams, sweet)
Dreams, sweet dreams for you (dreams, sweet dreams)

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

Dreams, sweet dreams for me (dreams, sweet)
Dreams, sweet dreams for you (dreams, sweet dreams)

Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
Good night


Goodbye

Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes
Tomorrow I
Will leave and go away

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on
I must be by his side

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, hi
Goodbye


Got To Get You Into My Life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had to hold you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there

Then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?


Grow Old With Me

Grow old along with me
The best is yet to be
When our time has come
We will be as one
God bless our love!
God bless our love!
Grow old along with me
Two branches of one tree
Face the setting Sun
When the day is done
God bless our love!
God bless our love!
Spending our lives together
Man and wife together
World without end!
World without end!
Grow old along with me
Whatever fate decrees
We will see it through
For our love is true
God bless our love!
God bless our love!


Hallelujah, I Love Her So

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the Sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

When I call her on the telephone
She says: Baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

In the evening when the Sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says: Baby everything is alright
That's why I know, that's why I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love that chick so


Happiness Is a Warm Gun

She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do
Oh, yeah

She's well acquainted with the touch
Of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd
With the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes
While his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife
Which he ate and donated
To the National Trust

I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, momma
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)

When I hold you in my arms (oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger (oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm (oh, yeah)
Because

(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Is a warm gun, momma
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes it is
Gun
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well don't you know that happiness
Is a warm gun, momma?
(Happiness is a warm gun, yeah)

You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl

So funny to see

My mind, mind, mind
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl

Mmm-mmm, you're my little girl
Mmm-hmm, you're my little girl
Oh, yeah, you're my little girl


Help!

Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone, help!

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?


Helter Skelter

When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter

Will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Look out, helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter

Look out, cause here she comes

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom and I see you again

Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

Look out, helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter
Look out, helter skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes, she is
Yes, she is

I got blisters on my fingers!


Her Majesty

Her majesty is a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her majesty is a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I wanna tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a belly full of wine
Her majesty is a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm gonna make her mine
Oh yeah, someday I'm gonna make her mine


Here, There And Everywhere

To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here
Making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can
Deny that there's something there

There
Running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking
But she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes
And hoping I'm always there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her

Everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes
And hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere


Here Comes The Sun

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say
It's all right

Little darling
It's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say
It's all right

Little darling
The smiles returning to the faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right


Hey Bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again

Somekind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

Childlike
No one understands
Jack Knife
In his sweaty hands

Somekind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Somekind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!


Hey Jude

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain
Hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders

For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na na na na na na

Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her now go and get her
Remember (hey, Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in
Hey, Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that is just you?
Hey, Jude, you'll do!
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na na na na na na

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better (better, better, better, better, better, oh!)
Na, na na na na na, na na na, hey, Jude
Na, na na na na na, na na na, hey, Jude


His Daughter Caroline

So few years ago her daddy held her in his arms
Snugged the blanket around her feet to help and keep 'em warm
When he kissed her tender cheek, oh, how her eyes would shine
His ev'ry dream was built around his daughter Caroline

He remembered ev'ry time she'd turn another year
And, at the birthday parties, when he'd shed a happy tear
Thinking of the wedding dress that she would wear someday
When he'd have to give his daughter Caroline away

He thought of what he saw the night they called her from the roll
A silver graduation ring and engagement ring of gold
It seems as tho' twas yesterday he met her valentine
And now she's grown and here to wed his daughter Caroline

Maarching on his arm she whispered, "Pa, I still love you"
Those words remained within his ears when she vowed, "I do"
Cheer was sparkling from his eyes, but tears were in behind
When he gave his heart away, his daughter Caroline

Never be the lonely one

Being here alone tonight with you

Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you

So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you,
You, you ,you, oo
You, oo

Honey Pie

She was a working girl
North of england way
Now she's hit the big time
In the U.S.A
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say
Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee

Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the atlantic
To be where you belong

Honey pie, come back to me!
(I like it like that)
(I like this kind of, hot kind of music)
(Hot kind of music)
(Play it to me, play it to me)
(Hollywood blues)

Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?

Honey pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

(Come, come back to me, honey pie oh oh oh!)
(Honey pie, honey pie!)


Honeymoon Song

I never knew that a day
Like today lay before us
I've got the Sun in my heart
And my heart's in the Sun
Skies are as bright
As your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is the ceiling
Feelings are reelings
Free as the air
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Who ever knew that we two
Could be free as we'd fancy
Fancy is free
But are we bound
To each other by love
To each other by love?
Who ever knew that we two
Could be free as we'd fancy
Fancy is free
But are we bound
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love


Hot As Sun

[Instrumental]


House Of The Rising Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.
And God, I know I'm one.
My mother was a tailor.
She sewed my new blue jeans.
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans.
Now, the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's all a-drunk.
Oh, Mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done.
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the house of the risin' sun.
Well, I've got one foot on the platform.
And the other's on the train.
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain.
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.
And God, I know I'm one.


I'll Always Be In Love With You

Sweetheart if you should stray a million miles away
I'll always be in love with you
And though you'll find more bliss in someone else's kiss
I'll always be in love with you.

I can't do any more i've tried so hard to please
But let me thank you for such tender memories
I wish you happiness as for me sweetheart
I guess i'll always be in love with you.

[instrumental]

(i'll always be in love with you)

I can't do any more i've tried so hard to please
But let me thank you for such tender memories
I wish you happiness as for me sweetheart
I guess i'll always be in love with you...


I'll Be Back

You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again

'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again

This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I've got a big surprise

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again

This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I want to go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you

You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again


I'll Be On My Way

The sun is fading away
that's the end of the day
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss, then I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

...to where the winds don't blow
and golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
and golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the Junelight
turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey
I'll be on my way, ooh
I'll be on my way, ooh
I'll be on my way


I'll Cry Instead

I've got every reason on Earth to be mad
'Cos I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder
That's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-ay-hay
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-ay-hay
But I'll come back again someday

And when I do you better hide all the girls
'Cos I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead


I'll Follow The Sun

One day you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

Some day you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun

And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know, oh

One day you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain

Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I'll Keep You Satisfied

You don't need anybody to hold you,
Here I stand with my arms open wide,
Give me love and remember what I told you -
I'll keep you satisfied.

You don't need anybody to kiss you,
Every day I'll be here by your side,
Don't go away, I'm afraid that I might miss you -
I'll keep you satisfied.

You can always get a simple thing like love anytime,
But it's different with a boy like me and a love like mine.

So believe everything that I told you,
And agree that with me by your side,
You don't need anybody to hold you -
I'll keep you satisfied.

I'll keep you satisfied.

Give me love and remember what I told you -

I'm a Loser

I'm a loser, I'm a loser,
And I'm not what I appear to be

Of all the love I have won or have lost,
There is one love I should never have crossed.
She was a girl in a million my friend,
I should have known she would win in the end.

I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown,
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown,
My tears are falling like rain from the sky,
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate,
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true pride comes before a fall,
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be


I'm Down

You tell lies thinkin' I can't see.
You can't cry 'cause you're laughin' at me.

I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (Down on the ground.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh know I'm down?

Man buys ring, woman throws it away.
Same old thing happen every day.

I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (Down on the ground.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh know I'm down?

We're all alone and there's nobody else.
She'll still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"

I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (Down on the ground.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh know I'm down?

A baby you know I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I guess I'm down. (I'm really down.)
I'm down on the ground. (I'm really down.)
I'm down. (I'm really down.)

Ah, baby, I'm upsidedown.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm really down.

I'm Just Sitting Here

People say I'm crazy
Doing what I'm doing
Well, they give me all kinds of warnings
To save me from ruin

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll

People say I'm lazy
Dreaming my life away
Well, they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll

No longer riding on the merry-go-round

Ah, people asks me questions lost in confusion
Well, I tell them there's no problem, only solutions

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
No longer riding on the merry-go-round


I'm Looking Through You

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learnt the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing over night

You're thinking of me the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing over night

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

(Yeah, baby, you've changed
I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you)


I'm Only Sleeping

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream

Please, don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need

Please, don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for that sleepy feeling

Please, don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream

Please, don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping


I'm So Tired

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

I'm so tired I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you, but I know what you would do

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git

You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind


I've Got a Feeling

I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah (that's right)
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no
Yeah. Yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!

Oh, please, believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah
I got a feeling

All these years, I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

I've got a feeling that keeps me on my toes
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah. Yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!

Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ev'rybody had a good year
Ev'rybody let their hair down
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up (yeah)
Ev'rybody put their foot down
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Wohoo!

(Oh, my soul, it's so hard)


I've Just Seen a Face

I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm

Had it been another day, I might have looked the other ways and
I'd have never been aware, but as it is I'll dream of her tonight

Missed things and kept out of sight for other girl we're never quite like this
Da da

Falling, yes, I'm falling
And she keeps calling me back again

Falling, yes, I'm falling

I Am The Walrus

I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly!
I'm crying!

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

I am the egg man!
They are the egg men!
I am the walrus!
Goo goo goo joob!

Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky!
See how they run!
I'm crying! I'm crying!
I'm crying! I'm crying!

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

I am the egg man!
They are the egg men!
I am the walrus!
Goo goo goo joob!

Sitting in an English garden waiting for the Sun
If the Sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus
Goo goo goo joob! (Good pity!)

Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

Semolina Pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

I am the egg man!
They are the egg men!
I am the walrus!
Goo goo goo joob!
Goo goo goo goo joob!
Goo goo goo joob
Goo goo goo goo job
Goo goo!
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob!


I Call Your Name

I call your name, but you're not there
Was I to blame, for being unfair
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night, I can't go on

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not goin' (to) mayayake it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh, I can't sleep at night, but just the same
I never weep at night, I call your name

Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not goin' (to) mayayake it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh, I can't sleep at night, but just the same
I never weep at night, I call your name
I call your name
I never weep at night, I call your name


I Don't Want To See You Again

I don't want to see you again

I hear that love is planned
How can I understand when someone says to me
I don't want to see you again?

Why do I cry at night?
Something wrong could be right,
I hear you say to me
I don't want to see you again!

As you turned your back on me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play at being broken hearted.

I know that later on after love's been and gone,
I'll still hear someone say
I dont' want to see you again!

As you turned your back on me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play at being broken hearted.

I hear that love is planned.
How can I understand when someone says to me
I don't want to see you again?

I don't want to see you again.
I don't want to see you again.
I don't want to see you again.


I Don't Want To Spoil The Party

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know

I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear

I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her

I've had a drink or two and I don't care

I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

I Forgot to Remember to Forget

I forgot to remember to forget her,
I can't seem to get her off my mind. 
I thought I'd never miss her, 
but I've found out somehow 
I think about her almost all the time.
Well the day she went away 
I made myself I promise 
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met. 
But something sure is wrong 
'cos I'm so blue and lonely: 
I forgot to remember to forget.

I Got To Find My Baby

I'm gonna search this town,
from door to door.
The love I crave
I can't find no more.
I got to find my baby,
I declare there ain't no lie.
I ain't had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.
You know I hate to see the sun
sinking to the west,
'cos I know my whole life's
gonna be one solid mess.

I ain't had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.

that she said we were through,
I've been nervous
and shook up too.
I got to find my baby,
I declare there ain't no lie.
I had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life,
is to find that little woman
make her my wife.
I got to find my baby,
I declare there ain't no lie.
I had no real good loving
since that woman said goodbye.


I Just Don't Understand

Well you call me your baby 
when you're holding my hand, 
But the way that you hurt me 
I just don't understand. 
Well you say that you need me 
like an ocean needs sand. 
But the way you deceive me 
I just don't understand. 
Well you know that I love you
more than anyone can. 
But a one sided love 
I just don't understand. 
Well you know that I love you
more than anyone can.

My head was in the whirl

But I loved my little girl
Oh oh oh oh

Well gather round people
Let me tell you the story
The very first song I wrote

You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Ooh)
When I saw her standin' there

That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)
When I saw her standin' there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

With a girl like you.
That I would love everything
That you do
And I do,
Hey, hey, hey,
And I do.

What a kiss could be.
This could only happen to me.
Can't you see?

Oh,
You're gonna say you love me too,
Oh,
And when I ask you to be mine,
You're gonna say you love me too

A lot of things before.

My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away

When I get near you
Things begin to drag me down
It's alright
I'll make you maybe next time around

But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things

I want to tell you

For the things you do endear you to me
You know I will
I will

If I Fell

If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart
To you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you
Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry
When she learns we are two

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain

In My Life

There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead, and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

In my life, I love you more

in spite of all that may be 
I'll do anything for you, 
anything you want me to,

In spite of all the heartache, 
that you may cause me, 
I'll do anything for you, 
anything you want me to,

like I've never done before.
I'll keep all the others 
from knocking at your door.

India

India, India,   take me to your heart 
Reveal your ancient mysteries to me 
I'm searchin' for an answer, but somewhere deep inside 
I know I'll never find it here - it's already in my mind 
 
India, India, listen to my plea 
Sit here at your feet so please don't leave 
I'm waiting by the river but somewhere in my mind 
I left my heart in England with the girl I left behind 
 
I've got to follow my heart wherever it takes me 
I've got to follow my heart wherever it calls to me 
I've got to follow my heart and my heart is going home 
 
pause 
 
India, India, listen to my plea 
I sit here at your feet so patiently 
I'm waiting by the river but somewhere in my mind 
I left my heart in England with the girl I left behind 

I've got to Follow my heart wherever it takes me 
I've got to follow my heart wherever it calls to me 
I've got to follow my heart and my heart is going home


It's All Too Much

It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time
Of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
Or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun
For I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
And get me home for tea

It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take it's all too much

It's too much
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
It's too much

With your long blonde hair and your eyes are blue
With your long blonde hair and your eyes are blue
You're too much
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
You're too much,ah
We are dead, ah!

Too much
Too much
Too much...


It's For You

I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do, it's for you.
Love true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true, it's for you

They said that love was a lie
Told me that I should never try to find
Somebody who'd be kind, kind to only me
So I just tell them, they're right, who
Wants a fight?
Tell them, I quite agree, nobody'd love me
Then I look at you, and
Love comes, love shows
I give my heart and no-one knows that I do
It's for you
It's for you

They said that love was a lie
Told me that I should never try to find
Somebody who'd be kind, kind to only me
So I just tell them, they're right, who
Wants a fight?
Tell them, I quite agree, nobody'd love me
Then I look at you, and
Love comes, love shows
I give my heart and no-one knows that I do
It's for you
It's for you


It's Only Love

I get high when I see you go by
My, oh, my
When you sigh, my mind inside just flies
Butterflies

Why am I so shy
When I'm beside you?

It's only love
And that is all
Why should I feel
The way I do?
It's only love
And that is all
But it's so hard
Loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes night time bright
Very bright

Haven't I the right
To make it up, girl?

It's only love
And that is all
Why should I feel
The way I do?
It's only love
And that is all
But it's so hard
Loving you
Yes, it's to hard
Loving you
Loving you


It Won't Be Long

It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you

Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own

It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you

Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more

It won't be long, yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, yeah
It won't be long, yeah, till I belong to you, woo

Jenn

So just remember the street feeds sea Queens, okay?
Shall we go then?
One, okay, you're ready?
One, two, three, four!

She asks me 'round to have a bite to eat
When I get there, she's invited the street

Jenn!

I tell her that I'd rather be alone
She gets the car and says she'll drive me home

Jenn!

Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me
Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me

She takes me home and slips on something cool
She let me kiss her where she don't as a rule

Jenn!

I tell her that I'd rather be alone
She gets the car and says she'll drive me home

Jenn!

Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me
Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me

Jenn! Jenn!
Jenn! Jenn!


Johnny B. Goode

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
There stood a long cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.

(Chorus)
Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go (x4)
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,
Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,
People passin' by they would stop and say
"Oh my but that little country boy can play"

(Chorus)

His momma told him "some day you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around,
To hear you play your music till the sun go down,
Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin 
'Johnny B. Goode' tonight"

(Chorus)


Julia

Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia

Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the Sun

Julia, Julia, morning Moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hum, hum, hum, calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia, Julia, Julia


Junk

Motorcars, handlebars
Bicycles for two
Broken hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for two

Motor cars, handle bars
Bicycles for two
Broken hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for you
Jamboree

Shop window
Why? Why?
Says the junk in the yard

Keep Your Hands Off My Baby

We've been friends for oh so long, 
I won't let you share what's mine. 
When you mess with the girl I love, 
it's time to draw the line. 
Keep your hands off my baby. 
Ain't a-gonna tell you 
one more time. 
So keep your hands off my baby,
for it's gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine. 
I don't mind if you lend my clothes,
...much 
There is something that you can't say.
There's one thing you don't touch. 
Keep your hands off my baby. 
Ain't a-gonna tell you 
one more time. 
So keep your hands off my baby,
for it's really gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine. 
Keep your hands off my baby.
Ain't a-gonna tell you 
one more time. 
So keep your hands off my baby,
for it's really gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine. 
Oh keep your hands off my baby,
she's mine. 
Keep your hands off my baby.
You'd better watch your step now
for it's really gonna do you in: 
that girl is mine

Lady Madonna

Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Who finds the money
When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace

See how they run

Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is neverending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending

See how they run

Lady Madonna
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet


Last Christmas

Wait
Oh yes, merry Christmas little girl
Wait
Last year, you left me, little girl...

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Last Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (Oh! yeah!)
But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god I thought you were
Someone to rely on Me?
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (and twice shy)
But the very next day you gave it away (you still catch my eyes)
This year
To save me from tears (do you recognize me?)
I'll give it to someone special (it doesn't surprise me)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (I wrapped it up and sent it)
But the very next day you gave it away (say I love you I meant it)
This year
To save me from tears (what a fool I've been)
I'll give it to someone special (I know you fool me again)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (oh! yeah!)
But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (from tears)
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (oh! yeah!)
But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (from tears)
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Lend Me Your Comb

Lend me your comb
It's time to go home
I got to go past
My hair is a mess

Your mammie will scold
Your pappie will shout
Unless we come in
The way we went out

Kissing you was fun, honey
But thanks for the date
But I must come to run, honey
But you know, baby, it's getting late

Just wait till I say
My darling
Lend me your comb
We got to go home

Kissing you was fun, honey
But thanks for the date
But I must come to run, honey
But sugar, it's getting late

Just wait till I
Say: My darling
Lend me your comb
We got to go home


Let's Dance

Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too,
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey baby, yeah, you thrill me so
Hold me tight, don't you let me go

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Maybe you'll let me walk you home

But let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too,
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

Hey, baby, things are swingin' right
Yes, I know that this is the night

Well let's dance, well let's dance
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dance that you wanna do
But let's dance, well let's dance

But let's dance
But let's dance

Let It Be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when all the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be

For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow
Let it be

I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Little Queenie

I got the lumps in my throat
When I saw her coming down the isle
I get the wiggles in my knee
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled

There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeh she looks like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen

Meanwhile I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got a chance, I ought to take it
If she'll dance, we can make it
Come on Queenie, let's shake it

Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
I said: go go go little Queenie

There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
She's looking like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen

Meanwhile I was still thinking,
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, that'll get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
Come on, Queenie, let's get with it

Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie

There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeh she looks like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen

Meanwhile I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got a chance, I ought to take it
If she'll dance, we can make it
Come on Queenie, let's shake it

Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie

Love Of The Loved

Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there a heaven lies
and as I look
I see the love of the loved.

Someday they'll see that from the start
my place has been deep in your heart.
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved.

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more,
now that I'm really sure
you love me.

And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way

and say ah you love me.

So let it rain, I'll never care?
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there.
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved.

Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more,

So let it rain, I'll never I care?
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there.
And when I'm there

I see the love of the loved.
I see the love of the loved.
I see the love of the loved.


Love These Goon Shows!

Rodney Burke: But now John has his work cut out on the next one, as he takes the guitar on and off his neck and pulls the harmonica in and out of his face.
John: Harp, it's a harp.

Love You To

Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me

Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man

A life-time is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

Make love all day long
Make love singing songs

There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with their sins you'll see

I'll make love to you
If you want me to


Lovely Rita

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glipmse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When you are free
To take some tea with me

Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two

Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you

Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid


Lovesick Blues

Got a feelin' cause I'm blue, oh, Lord
Since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
All I do is sit and cry, oh, Lord
That last long day he said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
He'll do ya, he'll do me, he's got that kinda lovin'
But, Lord, I love to hear him when he calls me sweet baby
What a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Now I'm in love, I'm in love with a wonderful guy
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a wonderful guy
But he don't care about me
Well, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
But now that he is leavin', this is all I've got to say

I got a feelin' cause I'm blue, oh Lord, since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

I've grown so used to that man, and how
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues


Loving You

I will spend my whole life through
Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, springtime too
Loving you, loving you

Makes no difference where I go or what I may do
You know that I'll always be loving you, just you

And if I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you

There is only one for me and you know who
You know that I'll always be loving you

Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the Sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds


Maggie Mae

Oh, dirty Maggie Mae
They have taken her away
And she'll never walk
Down Lime Street anymore
Oh, the judge she guilty found her
Of robbing the homeward bounder
Dirty no good robbin' Maggie Mae
It's the part of Liverpool
She returned me to
Two pound ten a week
That was my pay

Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues

She wrote me only one sad night,
told me she's no longer mine. 
Sue sue mailman, that will do for sometime.
Mailman, bring me no more blues.

One more heartache is all I can use.

Martha My Dear

Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation, please
Remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear

Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you, silly girl

Take a good look around you
Take a good look and you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
For each other
Silly girl

Hold your hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you, silly girl

Martha, my dear, you have always been my inspiration, please
Be good to me, Martha, my love
Don't forget me, Martha, my dear


Matchbox

I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure
Got a long way to go

I'm an ol' poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I'm an ol' poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I'll never be happy, cause everything I've
Ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please, don't shake my tree
Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please, don't mess around my tree
I got news for you, baby
Leave me here in misery

Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I sure
Got a long way to go


Maxwell's Silver Hammer

Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa, oa, oa, oan?

But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times: I must not be
So-o-o

But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. thirty-one said: We caught a dirty one
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o

But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Silver hammer


Maybelline

Maybelline why can't you be true
Oh maybelline
Why can't you be true
You done started doing the things
You use to do

As i was motivating over the hill
Saw maybelline in a coup deville
A cadillac rolling on old glen road
Nothing out run my v-8 ford
A cadillac doing about 95
It was bumper to bumper side to side

(Chorus)

Maybelline
Why can't you be true
Oh maybelline
Why can't you be true
You done started back doing the things
You use to do

A cadillac pulled up to 104
Before it got hot it would do no more
It done got cloudy and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passing lane
A rain water blowing all under my hood
I new that was doing my motor good

(Chorus)

(Solo)

(Chorus)

The water cooled down the heat went down
But under the hood the highway sound
Cadillac sat like a towing lane
110 a half a mile ahead
Cadillac look like it was standing still
I caught maybelline at the top of the hill

(Chorus)

(Solo)


Mean Mr. Mustard

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper

Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter

Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man


Memphis Tennessee

Long distance information 
give me Memphis Tennessee. 
Try to find the party 
trying to get in touch with me.
She would not leave her number 
but I know who placed the call. 
'Cos my uncle took the message 
and he wrote it on the wall. 
Help me, information, 
get in touch with my Marie. 
She's the only one who'd phone me here
from Memphis Tennessee. 
Her home is on the south side
just beyond the ridge, 
just a half a mile 
from the Mississippi Bridge.
Help me, information, 
more than that I cannot add. 
Only that I miss her 
and all the fun we had. 
We were pulled apart 
because her mom would not agree. 
Help me get in touch with her 
in Memphis Tennessee. 
The last time I saw Marie 
she was waving me goodbye, 
with hurry homedrops on her cheek
that trickled from her eyes. 
Marie is only six years old, 
information please. 
Help me get in touch with her
in Memphis Tennessee.

Moonlight Bay

We were strolling along (twist and shout!) 
On Moonlight Bay (woo hoo!) 
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
You said you'd stay 
You have broken my heart (oh, twist and shout!) 
So go away 
With your short and hairy legs 
On Moonlight Bay 
On Moonlight Bay


Mother Nature's Son

Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone

Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies

Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the Sun

Mother Nature's son


Mr. Moonlight

And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love

'Cause we love you
Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
Come again please
Here I am on my knees
Beggin' if you please

No Reply

This happened once before
When I came to your door, no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window

I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said that you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

I've tried to telephone
They said you were not home, that's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw her walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply


Nobody's Child

As i was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the childern play
Alone a boy was standing
And when i asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry


I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I am growing wild
I've got no mammy's kisses
I've got no, no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child

No mammy's arms to hold me
Or soothe me when i cry
'cause sometimes i feel so lonesome
I wish that i could die
I'd walk the streets of heaven
Where all the blind can see
And just like all the other kids there'd be a home for me

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm, i'm growing wild
I've got no mammy's kisses
I've got no, no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child


Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)

I once had a girl
Or should I say
She once had me

She showed me her room
Isn't it good?
Norwegian wood

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug
Biding my time
Drinking her wine

We talked until two
And then she said
It's time for bed

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone
This bird has flown

So I lit a fire
Isn't it good?
Norwegian wood


Not a Second Time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cried for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cried, it's true, oh

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no
Not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cried for you, yeah

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cried, it's true, oh

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
not a second time
Not a second time
no, no, no, no, no
no, no no


Not Guilty

Not guilty
For getting in your way
While you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest
I'm not trying to steal your vest

I am not trying to be smart
I only want what I can get

I'm really sorry for your ageing head
But like you heard me said
Not guilty

Not guilty
For being on your street
Getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ
While I'm trying to do my bit

I don't expect to take your heart
I only want what I can get

I'm really sorry that you're underfed
But like you heard me said
Not guilty

Not guilty
For looking like a freak
Making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray
On the road to Mandalay

I won't upset the apple cart
I only want what I can get

I'm really sorry that you've been misled
But like you heard me said
Not guilty


Nothing Shaking

I found it out, what love is all about
And every day, it sure lets out
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees

She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please

Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah

She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please

Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees


Now And Then

I know it's true, it's all because of you
And if I make it through, it's all because of you
And now and then, if we must start again
Well we were not sure, that I love you

I don't want to lose you - oh no, no, no
Lose you or abuse you - oh no, no, no, sweet doll
But if you have to go, away
If you have to go, I know, you never to come

Now and then, I miss you
Oh now and then, I want you
Come back to me, I know, return to me

I know it's true, it's all because of you
And if you go away, I know, you no back to me

I don't want to lose you - oh no, no, no
Abuse you or confuse you - oh no, no, no, sweet doll
But if you had to go, away
Well I won't stop you baby
And if you had to go
Well, you don't believe in we


Nowhere Man

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans
For nobody

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all?

Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all 'till somebody else
Lends you a hand

Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command

He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans
For nobody
Making all his nowhere plans
For nobody
Making all his nowhere plans
For nobody

Octopus's Garden

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus' garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus' garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden with you


Oh! Darling

Oh, darling
Please, believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Oh, darling
If you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know
I nearly broke down and cried

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know
I nearly broke down and died

Oh, darling
If you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

Believe me, darling

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know
I nearly broke down and died

When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know
I nearly broke down and died

Oh, darling
Please, believe me
I'll never let you down
Oh, believe me, darling
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm


Old Brown Shoe

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you cam here it won't be the same now I'm telling you
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replacing ev'ry thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now I'm telling you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe some day
Who knows baby
You may comfort me
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows baby
You may comfort me
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start I'm making sure that I'm not late
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you


One After 909

My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

They've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says: You've got the the wrong location
They've got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

They've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says: You've got the the wrong location
They've got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 909

(Oh Danny Boy, the old summer is calling)


One And One Is Two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say.
You really make my dreams come true.

Can't you feel, when I'm holding you near
All the things I do
Show my love and I'm making it clear
One and one is two

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day

Don't you love me too?

From wanting you

One and one is two
What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say.
You really make my dreams come true.

If you say that you're gonna be mine
Everything's alright
All the world would look so fine.

What am I to do
Now that I'm in love with you.
I'm hoping every day
I'm gonna hear you say.
You're really make my dreams
You're really make my dreams
You're really make my dreams come true.


Only a Northern Song

If you're listening to this song,
You may think the cords are going wrong.
But they're not
We just wrote it like that

When you're listening late at night,
You may think the bands are not quite right,
But they are,
They just play it like that

It doesn't really matter what chords I play,
What words I say,
Or time of day it is
As it's only a northern song

*music*

It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear,
Or how I pur
Or if my hair is brown
When it's only a northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key,
You're correct,
There's nobody there

And it told you there's no one there

*music*

Peace Of Mind (The Candle Burns)

I'm looking at the candle, burns a flame to meet the sky.
I leave the candle laughing, I turn my face to cry.
A safety pin returns my smile, I nod a brief hello,
while you are building molecules with your garden hoe.

Why can't this last forever-these things repressed inside?
One feels it almost instantly, unless one of us died.
It's over, it's done, babe I need it again.
Just please, please, please, oh, don't keep me from begin.

I need to hear the colors red and blue and whispered word.
To fly all day and sing in tune and not hear what I'd heard.
To see you all around me and to take you by the hand,
and lead you to a brand new world that lately has been banned.

We'll build things never built before, we'll do things never done.
And just before it's over, it's really just begun.
(Hush)


Peace Of Mind

As I stood on the doorstep of romance
You told me
Then you threw your loving arms around me
and you gave me, yes gave me, you gave
Peace of mind


Penny Lane

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to known
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say: Hello!

On the corner is a banker with a motor car
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It¬¥s a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

Penny Lane!


Piggies

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies,
Life is getting worse;
Always having dirt to
Play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to
Play around in.

In their styes with all their backing,
They don't care
What goes on around.
In their eyes there's something lacking.
What they need's a damn good whacking.

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives.
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives.
Clutching forks and knives to
Eat their bacon.

Putting' On The Style

Eighteen and eighty-four, June the twenty-first
Thought I'd write a poem, if I could a verse
Sitting by the window something made me smile
I saw a fellow passing, putting on the style

Putting on the agony, putting on the style
What the stylish people are a-doing all the while
When I look around me I very often smile
To see so many people putting on the style

Young man and his true love a-going to see the scenes
Looking mostly like a bunch of garden greens
Gingerbread and candy eating all the while
Going to see the show, boys, putting on the style

Putting on the agony, putting on the style
What the stylish people are a-doing all the while
When I look around me I very often smile
To see so many people putting on the style

Young man in the the carriage, going like mad
Pair of spanking horses he borrowed from his dad
Cracked his whip so suddenly he made the ladies smile
Oh, isn't he a-going it, putting on the style.

Putting on the agony, putting on the style
What the stylish people are a-doing all the while
When I look around me I very often smile
To see so many people putting on the style

Young man in the dramshop, smokes the dirty pipe
Looking like a pumpkin only partly ripe
Drinks, swears, and gambles, thinking all the while
That this is something equal to putting on the style

Putting on the agony, putting on the style
What the stylish people are a-doing all the while
When I look around me I very often smile
To see so many people putting on the style

Preacher in the pulpit shouts with all his might
"Glory Hallelujah!" with the people in a fright
Thinking of pretences come out on double file
But the preacher's only putting on the style

Putting on the agony, putting on the style
What the stylish people are a-doing all the while
When I look around me I very often smile
To see so many people putting on the style

Sweet sixteen at meetin', going to see the boys,
She turns her head and sniggers at every little noise
She turns her head on this side, and then on that a while
Oh, isn't she a swell, boys, putting on the style

Putting on the agony, putting on the style
What the stylish people are a-doing all the while
When I look around me I very often smile
To see so many people putting on the style


Rain

If the rain comes, they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes, if the rain comes

When the Sun shines, they slip into the shade (when the Sun shines)
And sip their lemonade (when the Sun shines)
When the Sun shines, when the Sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you that when it starts to rain (when the rain comes)
Everything's the same (when the rain comes)
I can show you, I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

Can you hear me that when it rains and shines (when it rains and shines)
It's just a state of mind (when it rains and shines)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?

Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping
The cats are going wild
The music really sends me

Gonna kick off my shoes
Roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock'n'roll baby
Pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left
I shuffle to the right
I'm gonna rock'n'roll
Till the early early night 'cause


Real Love

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid

It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone

It's real love
It's real
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real
It's real love
It's real


Red Hot

[Chorus]

My gal is red hot
Your gal ain't doodly squat
Yeah, my gal is red hot
Your gal ain't doodly squat
Well, she ain't got no money
But man, she's a-really got a lot

Well, I got a gal, six feet four
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet out the door, but

[Chorus and guitar solo]

Well, she walks all night, talks all day
She's the kinda woman who'll have her way, but

[Chorus and piano solo]

Well, she's the kinda woman who louds around
Spreadin' my business all over town, but

[Chorus and guitar solo]

Well, she's a one man's woman, that's what I like
But I wish she wasn't gonna change her mind everynight, but

[Chorus]


Red Sails In The Sunset

Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me

She sailed at the dawning
Oh way out and blue
Red sails in the sunset
I'm counting on you

Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me

Sweet wind we must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We'll marry tomorrow
And you'll go sailing no more

Red sails in the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me

Sweet wind we must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We'll marry tomorrow
And she'll go sailing no more

Red sails at the sunset
Way out of the sea
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me
Oh carry my love one
Home safely to me


Reminiscing

Until setting be in a left hand
Holding you, feel so glad, so baby, oh baby

I still love her all over,
Anytime inside of me, any more
I can't over you, oh baby oh
What a hard, all time
You know my heart so timed.

When I think of that she told,
You know how hard to think of
Dreaming, oh, I'm only dreamin'
That my love told me now
That she feel so tired of me,
Oh yeah only I know, oh I loose baby
Till I thinking of her
Till I thinking of her, tell I thinking of her

...then there's this Welsh rarebit wearing some brown underpants...
...about the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire.
Every one of them knew that as time went by they'd get a little bit older and little bit slower but.. It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always‚Ä¶

Umpteen times your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving....
Intended to die hateful Ottoman...
Long gone through...
I've got to say, irritably and...
Floors, hard enough to put on
Per day's MD in our district
There was not really enough light to get down
and ultimately slumped down
Suddenly...

They may stop the funding...
Place your bets. The original
Afraid she'll die
Great colors for the season....

Operador an√¥nimo:
Number 9 Number 9

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

Operador an√¥nimo:
Number 9 (12 times)

I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing..
A business deal falls through...
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives....

John Lennon:
People right, people right, right, right, right

Operador an√¥nimo:
Number 9, Number 9, Number 9, Number 9

John Lennon:
Riiiiiiiight! Riiiiiiiiight!

Operador an√¥nimo:
Number 9 Number 9 Number 9 Number 9

I've missed all that
It makes me a few days late compared with, wow!
And weird stuff like that...

Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have bought this specimen
I have nobody's short cuts, aha...

Operador an√¥nimo:
Number 9 Number....

George Harrison:
With the situation

John Lennon:
They are standing still

George Harrison:
The plan, the telegram

John Lennon:
Ooh ooh

Operador an√¥nimo:
Number 9, number

John Lennon:
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to my son
He really can try, as they do
To find function...
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low
And his hive high, and his eyes were low
Alright!

It was on fire
And his glasses were the same
This thing knows if it was tinted
But you know it isn't.
To me it is..

Operador an√¥nimo:
Number 9 &lt;11 times&gt;

John Lennon:
So the wife called me
And we'd better go see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it...
Yellow underclothes
So, any road
We went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all. So I said I'd marry, join the fucking Navy and went to sea

In my broken chair
My wings are broken and so is my hair
I am not in the mood for whirling

How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
....only to find the night-watchmen unaware of his presence in the building.

Revolution

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world

But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be

All right
All right
All right

You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We're all doing what we can

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be

All right
All right
All right

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead

But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be

All right
All right
All right

Riding On a Bus

Brian : Before we hear another song fellows, there are a few things I'd like to ask you.  First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
Paul  : Get so tired now, get a bit a lonely now.
John  : Rhythm, who's that? Blues.
Paul  : I don't think so, really. No. Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubish about you, which you get often.
Brian : I agree with that.  I've had a divorce and a half a dozen kids.
Brian : Now what do you, uh, well, I mean doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that stuff?
John  : No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, see?
Brian : Yeah, that's my point, but what about the simpler things of life. Like, uh...
Paul  : Like riding a bus.
Brian : yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you can find?
Paul  : Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
John  : We go to certain ones.
George: And we go to ones where the people there are so snoby their the type who pretend they don't know us, we have a good time, 'cause they pretend that don't know us.
Paul  : John's Cath.
Brian : Yeah, that figures.
Paul  : See, John's Cath.? Social comment that, you know? It is.

Rock and Roll Music

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too damn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
The folks are dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can gear some of that
Rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't blues it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me


Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree

Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way, hey

You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way

Rocking around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday


Rocky Raccoon

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye, Rocky didn't like that
He said: I'm gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said: Danny boy, this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said: Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival


Roll Over Beethoven

We're gonna write a little letter

It's a rockin' little record

My heart's beatin' rhythm

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven

Savoy Truffle

Cream tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news

But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream and nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues

But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through, you're gonna know and how
The sweat's gonna fill your head
But when it becomes too much, you'll shout aloud

But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me where you are?

September In The Rain

The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down
Remember in september in the rain.
The sun went out
Just like a light
Remember in september in the rain.

Of love i heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still september
Oh that september in the rain.

People tell me that she's only
Fooling, I know she isn't

She don't give the boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give the boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as
Loving, don't ask me why

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

She's Leaving Home

Wednesday morning at five o'clock, as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

She
(We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving
(Sacrified most of our lives)
Home
We gave her everything money could buy
She's leaving home after living alone (bye, bye)
For so many years

Father snores as his wife gets into
Her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that¬¥s lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy, our baby is gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?

She
(We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving
(Never a thought of ourselves)
Home
We struggled hard all our lives to get by
She's leaving home after living alone (bye, bye)
For so many years

Friday, morning at nine o'clock, she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

She
(What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having
(We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun
(Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (bye, bye)
For so many years

She's leaving home
Bye, bye


She Came In Through The Bathroom Window

(Oh, listen to that now, eheheh
Oh look out! It's!)

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh, yeah


She Loves You

She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say

She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she says she knows
You're not the hurting kind

She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad

She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologize to her

Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad

She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

With a love like that you know you should be glad
With a love like that you know you should be glad
With a love like that you know you should be glad

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


She Said She Said

She said
I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
And she's making me feel like
I've never been born

I said
Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like
I've never been born

She said: You don't understand what I've said
I said: No, no, no, you're wrong
When I was a boy
Everything was right
Everything was right

I said
Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
Because you're making me feel like
I've never been born

She said: You don't understand what I've said

Sick To Death

I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics

All by myself
Ain't got nobody else
Ain't got nobody else

I've had enough of watching scenes
Of schizophrenic, ego-centric, paranoiac, prima-donnas
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians

All by myself
Ain't got nobody else
Ain't got nobody else

I should hate you
But I hate to lose you
I don't want you

I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics

All by myself
Ain't got nobody else
Ain't got nobody else

Ain't got nobody else

Skinny Minnie

My skinny Minnie is a crazy chick,
Six foot high and one foot thick
Do I love her
Does a boy love pie
She is the apple of my eye,
Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny, she's tall, that's all

Tho' her shadow doesn't take much ground
What there is sure gets around
What there ain't that's what she be
'N' even that's too much for me
Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny, she's tall, that's all

Slightly slimmer than a fishing pole
One half rock and one half roll
Dig that chick from either side
Man, you'll yell "Where did she hide"
Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny, she's tall, that's all

Something (Studio Demo)

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover

Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

You know I love that woman of mine
And I need her all of the time
Now I'm telling you
That woman, that woman don't make me blue

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You know I believe and how

Sour Milk Sea

If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have long.

Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there.

If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there.

Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there.

Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way brings results.



Steek 'm Op

Steek 'm op, steek 'm op in je mond en begin
te roken, smoken en haal 'm in je longen
en als je net bent begonnen
voel je dat de stress zo wordt verdrongen.
Door die blunt straight to the point,
een splunt, een stikie of liever een joint.
Van harddrugs heb ik geen hoge dunk ik rook alleen skunk, punk.
Pak het op, rol het op, steek'm op en rook'm op
je passed'm door je kicked erop en opeens dan is ie op.
Zwarte piet wiede wiede wiet,
je ruikt hem wel je rookt hm niet.
Ben je stoned en word je dronken
je hart gaan bonken, nu ben je stronken.
Je taaie kwaaie moet zich ontlaaien,
dus het wordt weer tijd om een joint te draaien.

Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja!
Steek 'm opja! (x2)
Rol 'm op, steek 'm op en rook 'm op ja!

Waar King woont wordt wied gekloond,
dus nu wordt hij stoned, beloond en bekroond.
Een puur natuur kuur van een uur, van King Arthur is iet zo duur.
Eigen teeltje, want dat scheelt je toch een geeltje
of een meier, we worden higher, het maakt ons blijer,
en als ik ga vrijen dan blijf ik glijen.
King's plantage wordt een ravage,
als we hem oogsten worden we het hoogste.
M'n plantjes worden dope, m'n plantjes worden doper,
je kan wel naar de coffeeshop maar dit is goedkoper.
Deze week is spacecake week, door King gekweekt dus Def bezweek.
Bij elk trekkie denkt ie aan een plekkie voor een stekkie
ik rol hem in een shaggie en dan voel ik me te gekkie!

Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja!
Rol'm op, steek 'm op en rook 'm op ja!

Ben je blowrijp, pak de blowpijp,
en zuig er aan zoals je home-pijp.
Kom een hier griet, en proef m'n wiet,
jij zuigt de joint en ik je tiet.
Geen slet in m'n bed met een sigaret
want ik rook alleen met vol pret
ik geniet ervan zoveel ik kan,
want bemoeierige bitchen houden we niet van.
Zotte teksten, ik zal er in flexen
om daarna met de posse te relaxen.
Rook je een joint dan voel je je space,
maar met de pijp krijg je hoogtevrees.
Kom maar gauw, het huis staat blauw,
genoeg T.H.C. voor mij en jou.
Dus wordt het saai, draai dan wat Tai,
en dan worden we zo high als een Vlaamse Papegaai.

Steek'm op ja! Steek 'm op ja! Steek'm op ja!
Rol'm op, steek'm op en rook'm op ja!

All day all night in da party
everyone smoking sensimilla.


Strawberry Fields Forever

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean, it must be high or low
That is, you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

Always, no, sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a No, I mean, a Yes
But it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever


Sun King

Everybody's happy

Swanee River

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away.
That's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

Way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Wo, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm a still a-longin' for the old plantation,
Oh, for the old folks at home.

Ah-oh-oh!

Oh, my my!

Well, way down upon the Swanee River,
Far, far away-hey.
Wo, that's where my heart is yearning ever,
Home where the old folks stay.

All up and down the whole creation,
Sadly I roam.
I'm still a-longin' for the old plantation,
And for the old folks at home.

All the world is sad and dreary,
Ev'rywhere I roam.
Oh, darkies, how my heart grows weary,
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home
Far from the old folks at home.


Sweet Georgia Brown

Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same
As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown
Fella‚Äôs sigh, and even cry for Sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why you know I don‚Äôt lie

It‚Äôs been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right it‚Äôs a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles‚Äô hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
Alright

I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don‚Äôt you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!

When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Don‚Äôt buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination

There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like it‚Äôs a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that don‚Äôt have Georgia Brown

Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh
Sweet Georgia Brown


Sweet Little Sixteen

They're really rocking in Boston
In Philadelphia PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down the Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen
Sweet little sixteen
She's just got to have
About half a million
Framed autopraphs
Her wall is filled with pictures
She gets them one by one
Becomes so excited
Oh watch her at the run boy
Oh mommy mommy

You know it's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy daddy
I beg of you
Please say it to mommy
It's alright with you
Sweet little sixteen
She's got the grown up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's sporting in high heeled boots
Oh but tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her trend
Become sweet sixteen
And back in class again
They're really rocking in Boston
In Philadelphia PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And down the Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
On down in New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen


Take Good Care Of My Baby

My tears are fallin', 'cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say

Take good care of my baby

And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Did you have to treat me oh, so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

If it's somethin' that I've said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me

Well, I'm beggin' on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
If there's anythin' I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it
I'm so in love with you

Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me


Thank You, Girl

Oh, oh
You've been good to me, you made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl, thank you, girl

That's When Your Heartaches Begin

If you find your sweetheart in the arms of a friend
That's when your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime must come to an end
That's when your heartaches begin

Love is a thing you never can share
When you bring a friend into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend
That's when your heartaches begin

If you find your sweetheart in the arms of your best friend, yeah brother
That's, that's when your heartaches begin
And you know, when all your dreams, when all your dreams of a lifetime
Must, must all come to an end

For you know that love is a thing that you never can share
And you know, when you bring a friend into your love affair

That Means a Lot

A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot.
And you know that your love
Is all you've got.
At times things are so fine
And at times they're not.
But when she says she loves you,
That means a lot.

A friend says that a love
Is never true.
And you know that this
Can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got.
When she says she loves you
That means a lot.

Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real

A friend says that your love
Won't mean a lot
And you know that your love
Is all you've got
A touch can mean so much
When it's all you've got.
When she says she loves you
That means a lot

Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, ah.
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah


The Ballad Of John And Yoko

Standing in the deck at South Hampton
Trying to get Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "you've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it  can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the seine
Peter brown called to say,"you can make it ok,
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The newspaper said "say what're you doin' in bed?"
I said "we only try to get us some peace"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to the charity
Last night the wife said "oh, boy when you're dead,
You don't take nothing with you, but your soul,
Think!"

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said "she's gone to his head,
They look just like 2 gurus in drag"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said " we wish you success,
It's good to have the both of you back"

Christ you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be
The way things are going they're going to crucify me


The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
But when he looked so fierce, his mummy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?


The Darktown Strutters Ball

I'll be there to get you in a taxi, honey
Better be ready by half past eight
Now baby don't be late
I wanna be there when the band starts playing

Remember when we get there honey
New steps I'm gonna have them all
I'm gonna dance out of both my shoes
When they play those general blues
Tomorrow night at the darktown strutters' ball

I'll be there to get you in a taxi, honey
Better be ready by half past eight

The Fool On The Hill

Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on the way head in the cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around


The Hippy Hippy Shake

For goodness sake

The Inner Light

Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth
Without looking out of my window
I can know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth
With out looking out of your window
You can know the ways of heaven

The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing


The Long And Winding Road

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you've never known
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door


The Night Before

We said our goodbyes
(Ah the night before)
Love was in your eyes
(Ah the night before)
Now, today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Were you tellin' lies?
(Ah the night before)
Was I so unwise?
(Ah the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night was a night
I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me want to cry

We said our goodbyes
(Ah the night before)
Love was in your eyes
(Ah the night before)
Now, today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before. Yes

When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before

Last night was a night
I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me want to cry

Were you tellin' lies?
(Ah the night before)
Was I so unwise?
(Ah the night before)
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before


The Speech of John Lennon

We Were Four Guys, That,
Eh... I Met Paul, Said, D'y' Wanna Join Me Band, You Know,
And Then George Joined,
And Then Ringo Joined.
We Were Just A Band That Made It Very, Very Big, That's All.


The Walk

Well I know you heard of Suzie Q.
I know you heard of the chicken too
I know you heard of the cha-cha too
But the walk is dance that you can do

You just walk
You just walk
Oh, you walk
Yes, you walk
Yeah, you walk
That's the walk.


Well I know you heard of the Texas hop
I know heard of the old foxtrot
But when you do the walk, you're do it in style
You just shake your hips and close your eyes.

And then you walk
Yeah, you walk
And you walk
Do the walk
Ah, you walk
Yes, you walk
Do the walk!

(Instrumental break)

Well I know you heard of the old mambo
And I know you heard of the old tango
But when you do the walk you stand in close
And don't step on your partners toes

You just walk
Yeah, you walk
Well, you walk
Yes, you walk
Ah, you walk
That's the walk

Now if you don't know what it's all about
Come to me and I'll show you how
We'll do it fast, we'll do it slow
Then you'll know the walk everywhere you go.

You just walk
And you walk
Now you walk
It's called the walk
You wanna walk

That's the walk
That's the walk
(repeat 'til fade)


The Word

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love.
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word love

In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it the word is good

Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word love

Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word love

Now that I know what I feel must be right
I mean to show ev'rybody the light

Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine it's sunshine
It's the word love

Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love


There's a Place

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

I think of you
And things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you."

In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
There's a place


Things We Said Today

You say you will love me
If I have to go.
You'll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.

Someday when I'm lonely,
Wishing you weren't so far away,
Then I will remember
Things we said today.

You say you'll be mine, girl,
'Til the end of time.
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.

Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will remember
Things we said today.

Me, I'm just the lucky kind.
Love to hear you say that love is luck.
And, though we may be blind,
Love is here to stay, and that's enough.

To make you mine, girl,
Be the only one.
Love me all the time, girl.
We'll go on and on.

Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.

Love is here to stay, and that's enough.

Someday when we're dreaming,
Deep in love, not a lot to say.
Then we will remember
Things we said today.


Think For Yourself

I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have if we close our eyes

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cos I won't be there with you

I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up you're gonna cause more misery

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cos I won't be there with you

Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify all the things that you should

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cos I won't be there with you

Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for your self
'Cos I won't be there with you


This Boy

That boy took my love away
He'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Oh, and this boy
Would be happy
Just to love you
But oh, my, that boy
Won't be happy
'Til he's seen you cry

This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

This boy
This boy
This boy

Till There Was You

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
'Till there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
'Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and you

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
'Till there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing

Tomorrow Never Knows

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

That ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game Existence to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning


Too Much Monkey Business

Running to and fro
Hard working at the mill
Never failed at the mill
There come a rotten bill
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Salesman talking to me
Trying to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it
You can pay me next week
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Blonde hair, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked and married
Get a home, settle down by the book
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Been to Yokohama, baby
Fighting in the war
Army bunk, army chow
Army clothes, army car
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need for me complaining
My objection's overruled
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Working in the filling station
Too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the oil
Check the tires, dollar gas?
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want you by the race
Get away and leave me

Two Of Us

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than
The road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that
Stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that
Stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

(We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye)


Wait

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we cried

It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone


Watching Rainbows

Standin' in the garden, waitin' for the sun to shine
Hand my umbrella, with this dirt I wish she was mine
Everybody doves, think a thing; it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watchin' rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Standin' in the garden, waitin' for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Lookin' at the bench of next door neighbours
Cryin' to my mom, I'm tryin' to set sabors
Everybody's got to have something hard to grow
Well, instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son, and make you one
You gotta get out son, and make you run
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry, though
Shoot big!
Shoot big!
Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big!
You gotta shoot big!
Until you shoot big
I can't stand

We Can Work It Out

Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While I see it your way
Run the risk of knowing
That our love may soon be gone

We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong
And still you think that it's all right

Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out
And get it straight or say goodnight

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend

I have always thought
That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While I see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart
Before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend

I have always thought
That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While I see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart
Before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

What Goes On

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?

I used to think of no one else, but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?


What You're Doing

Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely,
Would it be too much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?
You got me running and there's no fun in it,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you,
Wond'ring what you're gonna do,
Should you need a love that's true, it's me.
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl,
Why should it be so much to ask of you,
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me.


When I'm Sixty Four

When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine?
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too, dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?


When I Get Home

Till I walk out that door - again

Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you this way

Whoa-ho, whoa-ho
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah

While My Guitar Gently Weeps

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps


White Christmas

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all 
Your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells 
All the way, all the way

Wild Cat

Don't ever try, to tame a wild cat
You'd just be wastin' your time
Just leave like you found me
Don't put no cage around me, oh-no, not me
You want a lamb, but I'm a wild cat
If you just keep that in mind
I'll let you hug and pet me
And then you gotta let me go free
Let me Be
You're a crazy, little kitten
But you just don't understand
Oh don't you chain me
Or try to train me
And you'll have me eatin' outta your hand
So don't forget that I'm a wild cat

And we'll just get along fine
The wild cat's what they name me
No kitten's gonna tame me, oh-no, not me
(Move over tiger)
You're a crazy, a-little kitten
But you just don't understand

And we'll just get along fine
The wild cat's what they name me
No kitten's gonna tame me, oh-no, not me.
Oh-no, not me, oh-no, not me, oh-no

Within You Without You

We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall
Of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
When it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there
(With our love)
With our love we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realise its all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you
And without you

We were talking
About the love thats gone so cold
And the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul
They dont know
They cant see
Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see
We're all one and life flows on
Within you and without you


Words Of Love

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you

Let me hear you say
the words I long to hear
Darling when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you


World Without Love

Please lock me away, and don't allow the day here
Inside where i hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say.
I won't stay in a world without love.

Birds sing out of tune and rain drops hide the moon
I'm ok, here i'll stay with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say.
I won't stay in a world without love.

So i wait and in a while i will see my true love smile
She may come, i know not when, when she does
I'll know, so baby until then, lock me away
And don't allow the day here.
Inside where i hide with my loneliness

I don't care what they say.
I won't stay in a world without love.

Yellow Submarine

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed the sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play!

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!

(Full steam ahead, Mr. Boatswain!
Full steam ahead!
Full steam ahead it is, Sgt!
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!)

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease!)
Everyone of us (everyone of us!) has all we need
(has all we need!)
Sky of blue (sky of blue!) and sea of green (sea of green!)
In our yellow (In our yellow!) submarine!
(Submarine, ha, ha!)

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!

We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!
We all live in a yellow submarine!
Yellow submarine! Yellow submarine!


Yer Blues

Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die!
Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why

In the morning
Wanna die!
In the evening
Wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

I'm lonely
Wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

Lonely
Wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl you know the reason why

The black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

Wanna die!
Yeah, wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why

Yesterday

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long
For yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know
She wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long
For yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

And you'll be mine

(She's gonna change her mind)
And I will take her out tonight
And I will treat her kind
(I'm gonna treat her kind)

You're gonna lose that girl
(Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose that girl
(Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)
You're gonna lose
(Yes, yes, you're gonna lose that girl)


You've Got To Hide Your Love Away

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feelin' two-foot small

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How could I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away


You Are My Sunshine

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried.
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me to love another,
You'll regret it all some day:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
You told me once, dear, you really loved me
and no one else could come between.
But now you've left me and love another;
you have shattered all my dreams:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away


You Can't Do That

I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Well, Its the second time
I've caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time I think its a sin
I think I'll let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Everybody's green
Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face.

So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings i'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

Wah!

(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)

Everybody's green
Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down (let you down)
And leave you flat (gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that

You Know What To Do

When I see you
I just don't know what to say.
I like to be with you
Every hour of the day.
So if you want me
Just like I need you,
You know what to do.

I watched you walking by
And you looked alone.
I hope that you won't mind
If I walk you home.
And if you want me
Just like I need you,
You know what to do.

Just call on me
When you're lonely.
I'll keep my love
For you only.

In every way.

You Like Me Too Much

Though you've gone away this morning you'll be back again tonight,
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right,
You'll never leave and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

You've tried before to leave me but you never had the nerve,
To walk out and makee me lonely which is all that I deserve,
You'll never leave and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

I really do and it's nice when you believe me if you leave me,

I will follow you and bring you back where you belong,
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I admit that I was wrong,
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

I really do and it's nice when you believe me if you leave me,

I will follow you and bring you back where you belong,
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I admit that I was wrong,
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.


You Never Give Me Your Money

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today (yes, it did)

One two three four five six seven
All good children go to heaven


You Really Got a Hold On Me

I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you,
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need to
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter. Tighter.

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me please, hold me squezee, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me


You Won't See Me

When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age

We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me
You won't see me

I don't know why you
Should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied

I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
And I can turn away
And you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years

Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years

Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me
Yeah


Young Blood

I saw her standing on the corner, 
a yellow ribbon in her hair. 
I couldn't stop myself from calling:
look a-there, look a-there, 
look a-there, look a-there. 
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. 
I can't get you out of my mind. 
I took one look and I was fractured,
I tried to walk but I was lame. 
I tried to talk but I just stuttered:
well what's your name, what's your name, 
well what's your name, what's your name. 
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. 
I can't get you out of my mind. 
A crazy stop, she was the top, 
I tried to follow her all the way home.
Things went bad, I met her dad 
he said: you'd better leave my daughter alone.
Well I tried to 
I saw the rising of the sun,
and all along my heart was falling,
while you're the one, you're the one, 
while you're the one, you're the one, 
Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. 
I can't get you out of my mind.

A Great Day For Freedom

On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived

On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone

Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of gray

I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitted residue slipped away...slipped away


A New Machine I

I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime

Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way it has always been?
Could it ever have been different?

Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever
Nobody lives forever


A New Machine II

I will always be in here
I will always look out from behind these eyes
It's only a lifetime
It's only a lifetime
It's only a lifetime


A Pillow Of Winds

A cloud of eiderdown draws around me
Softening the sound
Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side
And she's breathing low, and the candle dies

When night comes down you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change the wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain
Is falling in a golden dawn

And deep beneath the ground the early morning sounds
And I go down
Sleepy time when I lie with my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And I rise like a bird,
In the haze when the first rays touch the sky
And the night winds die


A Saucerful Of Secrets

Instrumental


A Spanish Piece

Pass the tequila, Manuela
Listen gringo
Laugh at my lisp and kill you

I think
This Spanish music
It sets my soul on fire
Lovely se√±orita
Your eyes are like stars
Your teeth are like pearls
Your ruby lips


Absolutely Curtains

Instrumental


Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast

Oh, uh, me flakes, then uh, scrambled eggs
Bacon, sausages, tomatoes, toast, coffee
Marmalade, I like marmalade, 
Porridge and uh any cereal I like all cereals
Oh God! Kickoff is 10am

[Rise And Shine]
Breakfast in Los Angeles, macrobiotic stuff

[Sunny Side Up]
I don't mind a barrack where I can bury my stuff in
I got a terrible back. When I work, it hurts me

It's ready for the gig
I don't know
This electrical stuff I can't bother with it so


Allons-y (2)




Animals

[Pigs On The Wing (Part 1)]
If you didn't care what happened to me
And I didn't care for you
We would zig-zag our way
Through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing

[Dogs]
You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake of this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone

[Pigs (Three Different Ones)]
Big man, pig man
Ha ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel
Ha ha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying "keep on digging"
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?

You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry

Bus stop rat bag
Ha ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Ha ha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hat pin
And good fun with a hand gun

You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry

Hey you Whitehouse
Ha ha, charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Ha ha, charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
You gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside

Mary you're nearly a treat
Mary you're nearly a treat
But you're really a cry

[Sheep]
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over jordan and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Blasting and bubbling I fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old

[Pigs On The Wing (Part 2)]
You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone
Or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe
To bury my bones
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing


Another Brick In The Wall (part I)

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A Snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what d'ya leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall


Another Brick In The Wall (part II)

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

Wrong, do it again!
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?
You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still, laddie!


Another Brick In The Wall (part III)

I don't need no arms around me
And I dont need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No! Don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall


Any Colour You Like

[Instrumental]


Apples And Oranges

Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly 
To meet the people
She's on time again 
And then 
I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you
See you

Thought you might to know
I'm the lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side
feeding ducks by the afternoon tide
(quack quack)
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges


Arnold Layne

Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine, washing line
They suit him fine

On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See-through baby blue
He dug it

Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Now he's caught, a nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang
He hates it

Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne, don't do it again!


Astronomy Domine

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, bow
Stairway scares: Dan, dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground


Atom Heart Mother

Tea, toast, coffee, yeah!
Sa, sa, sa, sa, sausage, roast beef
Here is a loud announcement
Silence in the studio!


Baby Lemonade

In the sad town
Cold iron hands clap
The party of clowns outside
Rain falls in gray far away
Please, please, baby lemonade

In the evening sun going down
When the earth streams in, in the morning
Send a cage through the post
Make your name like a ghost
Please, please, baby lemonade

I'm screaming, I met you this way
You're nice to me like ice
In the clock they sent through a washing machine
Come around, make it soon, so alone...
Please, please, baby lemonade

In the sad town
Cold iron hands clap
The party of clowns outside
Rain falls in gray far away
Please, please, baby lemonade

In the evening sun going down
When the earth streams in, in the morning
Send a cage through the post
Make your name like a ghost
Please, please, baby lemonade


Biding My Time

Wasting my time, 
Resting my mind 
And I'll never pine 
For the sad days and the bad days 
When we was workin' from nine to five. 
And if you don't mind 
I'll spend my time 
Here by the fire side 
In the warm light and the love in her eyes. 
And if you don't mind 
I'll spend my time 
Here by the fire side 
In the warm light of her eyes


Bike

I've got a bike.
You can ride it if you like.
It's got a basket, a bell that rings and
Things to make it look good.
I'd give it to you if i could,
But i borrowed it.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I've got a cloak. it's a bit of a joke.
There's a tear up the front. it's red and black.
I've had it for months.
If you think it could look good,
Then i guess it should.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.
I don't know why. i call him gerald.
He's getting rather old,
But he's a good mouse.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men.
Here a man, there a man,
Lots of gingerbread men.
Take a couple if you wish.
They're on the dish.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.
I'll give you anything, ev'rything
If you want things.

I know a room full of musical tunes.
Some rhyme, some ching.
Most of them are clockwork.
Let's go into the other room
And make them work.


Brain Damage

The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path

The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the Moon

The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door and throw away the key
There's someone in my head, but it's not me

And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the Moon

(I can't think of anything to say, except
I think it's marvellous)


Breakthrough

I can take or leave it, won't be the woebegone
Don't need a model universe to hang your pictures on
You hide somewhere, you die somewhere and then this senseless thought:
By hating more, you're feeling more, and that's how you get caught
They're never gonna make it easy, of this you can be sure
I'll greet you from your wilderness, i'll stay inside your door

There is no cage or prison, they have no fence too tall
You die more times than anyone and there's still no place to fall
They're never gonna keep it simple, this comes down from above
I have no helm, no secret realm, i dream to be at the heart of love, a part
Of love

I bet you can conceal it, but that's just a dead-end track
I'll cover you like the driven snow, and then i'll bring you back
You'll see, you'll feel like, you'll feel like a banner, unfurled and gently
Blown
And there before your opening eyes the self you've never known
They're never gonna make it easy, of this you can be sure
You'll feel untied, beatified, and loved forever more...


Breathe (Reprise)

Breathe
Breathe, breathe in the air.
Don't be afraid to care.
Leave but don't leave me.
Look around and choose your own ground.

Long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be.

Run, rabbit run.
Dig that hole, forget the sun,
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave.

On The Run
[female announcer, announcing flights at airport]
"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, HaHaHaaaaaa!"

Time/Breathe Reprise
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for soemone or something to show you the way.

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it'ssinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to nought or half a page of scribbledlines
Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.

Breath Reprise
Home, home again.
I like to be here when I can.
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

The Great Gig in the Sky
"And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I
don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime."

"I never said I was frightened of dying."

Money
Money, get away.
Get a good job with good pay and you're okay.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team.

Money, get back.
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet.

Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
giving none away.

"HuHuh! I was in the right!"
"Yes, absolutely in the right!"
"I certainly was in the right!"
"You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for abruising!"
"Yeah!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"
"I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He wasasking
why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and
screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely.
It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out"

Us and Them
Us, and them
And after all we're only ordinary men.
Me, and you.
God only knows it's noz what we would choose to do.
Forward he cried from the rear
and the front rank died.
And the general sat and the lines on the map
moved from side to side.
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who.
Up and down.
But in the end it's only round and round.
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried.
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside.

"I mean, they're not gunna kill ya, so if you give 'em a quickshort,
sharp, shock, they won't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off
lightly, 'cos I would've given him a thrashing - I only hit himonce!
It was only a difference of opinion, but really...I mean goodmannersdon't cost nothing do they, eh?"

Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about.
With, without.
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind.
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died.

Any Colour You Like

Brain Damage
The lunatic is on the grass.
The lunatic is on the grass.
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.
Got to keep the loonies on the path.

The lunatic is in the hall.
The lunatics are in my hall.
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more.

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

The lunatic is in my head.
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.

You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear.
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

"I can't think of anything to say except..."
"I think it's marvellous! HaHaHa!"

Eclipse
All that you touch
All that you see
All that you taste
All you feel.
All that you love
All that you hate
All you distrust
All you save.
All that you give
All that you deal
All that you buy,
beg, borrow or steal.
All you create
All you destroy
All that you do
All that you say.
All that you eat
everyone you meet
All that you slight
everyone you fight.
All that is now
All that is gone
All that's to come
and everything under the sun is in tune
but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.

"There is no dark side of the moon really. Matter of fact it'sall dark."


Breathe

Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, but don't leave me
Look around, choose your own ground

For long you'll live and high you'll fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one

For long you'll live and high you'll fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave


Bring The Boys Back Home

Bring the boys back home.
Bring the boys back home.
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no.
Bring the boys back home.

"Wrong! Do it again!"
"Time to go!
"Are you feeling okay?"
"There's a man answering, but he keeps hanging up!"
Is there anybody out there?


Burning Bridges

Bridges burning gladly
Merging with the shadows
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher
Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way
Magic visions stirring
Kindled by and burning flames rise in her eyes
The door stands ajar
The wall that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band


Cadence And Cascade

Cadence and Cascade
Kept a man named Jade
Cool in the shade
While his audience played
Purred, whispered, "Spend us too:
We only serve fo you"

Sliding mystified
On the wine of the tide
Stared pale-eyed
As his veil fell aside
Sad paper courtesan
They found him just a man.

Caravan hotel
Where the sequin spell fell
Custom of the game
Cadence oiled in love
Licked his velvet gloved hand
Cascade kissed his name.

Sad paper courtesan
They knew him just a man


Call The Schoolmaster

I always said he'd come to no good
In the end your honor
If they'd let me have my way
I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today
Crazy toys in the attic I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
Crazy toys in the attic he is crazy
They must have taken my marbles away
You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should talked to me more often
Than you did
But no you had to go your own way.
Have you broken any homes up lately?
Just five minutes Worm your honor him
And me alone
Come to mother baby let me hold you in my arms
I'm red I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me
Worm your honor let me take him home
Crazy over the rainbow I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
Crazy over the rainbow he is crazy
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for
The jury to retire
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before of
Some one more deserving
The full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with an urge to defecate
But my friend you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall


Candy And A Currant Bun

Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......
Oooh, don't talk to me
Please just fuck with me
Please you know I'm feeling frail
It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream, taste good in the afternoon
Ice cream, taste good if you eat it soon
Oooh, don't touch me child
Please you know you drive me wild
Please you know I'm feeling frail
Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very very very frail
Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......


Careful With That Axe, Eugene

Down, down. Down, down. 
The star is screaming.
Beneath the lies. 
Lie, lie. 
Tschay, tschay, tschay.

Careful... 
Careful...
Careful with that axe, Eugene.

The stars are screaming loud.
Tsch.
Tsch.

Chapter 24

A movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset

The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise

A movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise


Childhood's End

You shout in your sleep.
Perhaps the price is just too steep.
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart.
Just one man beneath the sky,
Just two ears, just two eyes.

You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories.
Childhood's end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities.
And then as the sail is hoist,
You find your eyes are growing moist.
All the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice.

Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky.
There'll be war, there'll be peace.
But ev'rything one day will cease.
All the iron turned to rust;
All the proud men turned to dust.
And so all things, time will mend.
So this song will end.


Cirrus Minor

In a churchyard by a river
Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses and the graze
Yellow bird, you are not lonely in singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving

Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to Cirrus Minor, saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later


Clowns And Jugglers

Trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'
You have no word
Trip, trip to a dream dragon
Hide your wings in a ghost tower
Sails cackling at every plate we break
Was cracked by scattered needles
The little minute gong
Coughs and clears his throat
Madam you see before you stand

Hey ho, never be still
The old original favorite grand
Grasshoppers green Herbarian band
And the tune they play is In Us Confide
So trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'
You have no word
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed
The madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot
The winds they blew and the leaves did wag

They'll never put me in their bag
The raging seas will always seep
So high you go, so low you creep
The wind it blows in tropical heat
The drones they throng on mossy seats
The squeaking door will always squeak
Two up, two down we'll never meet
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Sit up, touching hips
To a madcap galloping chase
Cheat he cried shouting kangaroo
It's true in their tree they cried
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!
The madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey ho, huff the Talbot

Comfortably Numb

Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Ok
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more
Harm
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going, through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I have become
Comfortably numb


Coming Back To Life

Where were you when I was burned and broken?
While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun

Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight into the shining sun


Confortably Numb

Hello? Hello? Hello?

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ah
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb


Corporal Clegg

Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war in 1944

Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo

Dear, dear were they really sad for me?
Dear, dear will they really laugh at me?

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame

Corporal Clegg recieved his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

Corporal Clegg
Corporal Clegg


Country Song

He made his way to the border
In the shadow under the trees
Down by a stream in a hollow
Turn your head feel the breeze

And the red Queen was waiting for the news
For the white King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

They let him in by a backway
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
and this is what she told the gathered round

Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn colour
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right

There will be no game today, she cried across the board
Everyday will be a holiday
And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad
And the Pink Queen sat
and smiled at the cat who smiled back


Crumbling Land

In a while I'll find the time to make the sunshine mine
In a smile I saw a single needle in the sky
Wheeling, soaring, gliding by
On a hill a little man with many shining things
Shiny pool, a shiny car and shiny diamond rings
Wining, dining, shining king
And the eagle flies in clear blue skys
Breathing in the clear blue air
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies
And fifty more come rolling off
The Ford production line
Then a man appearing like up in our on the sand
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land
Screaming, scheming, movie man
Here we go, hold your nose and see if something blows
Close your eyes, count to ten and see the sunrise rise
Climbing, higher, to the sky
Climbing all the birds a lake the dove the lies
On the finger of the king
On high the eagle spies the glitter of a gun
And wheeling in a climbing turn he flies into the sun


Crying Song

We smile and smile
We smile and smile
Laughter echoes in your eyes
We climb and climb
We climb and climb
Footfalls softly in the pines
We cry and cry
We cry and cry
Sadness passes in a while
We roll and roll
We roll and roll
Help me roll away the stone


Cymbaline

The path you tread is narrow
And the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping
Like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end
Will the final couplet rhyme
And it's high time
Cymbaline
And it's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me
A butterfly with broken wings
Is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in
There's nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home
And it's high time
Cymbaline
And it's high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy round your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you that they're moving into range
And Dr. Strange is always changing size
And it's high time
Cymbaline
And it's high time
Cymbaline
And it's high time
Cymbaline
And it's high time
Cymbaline


Daybreak

{a version of grantchester meadows}

Icy wind of night, be gone
This is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog-fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the king-fisher
Flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow i lay me down
All around me, golden sunflakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday in to my city room
Hear the lark and harken
To the barking of the dog-fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the king-fisher
Flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down.
All around me,
Golden sunflakes covering the ground,
Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.


Dogs

You got to be crazy
Gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes
And when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
Then moving in silently downwind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right
Without thinking

And after a while
You can work on points for style
Like the club tie and a firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's gonna get harder, harder and harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end, you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone

And it's too late to lose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

Gotta admit
That I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me
As if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off
This creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb and blind
You just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable
And no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain?
Who was trained not to spit in the fan?
Who was told what to do by the man?
Who was broken by trained personnel?
Who was fitted with collar and chain?
Who was given a pat on the back?
Who was breaking away from the pack?
Who was only a stranger at home?
Who was ground down in the end?
Who was found dead on the phone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?


Don't Leave Me Now

Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a saturday night
Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe
Why are you running away?
Ooh, babe

Echoes

Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky


Eclipse

All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel

And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save

And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy
Beg, borrow or steal

And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say

And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight

And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come

And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

(There is no dark side of the moon, really
Matter of fact it's all dark)


Embryo

All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sun shine through

All around I hear strange sounds
Come drifting round my ears
Dark the light and long the night
I feel my dawn is near

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sun shine through


Empty Spaces

What shall we use to fill the empty
Spaces where we used to talk
How shall I fill the final places
How shall I complete the wall


Fat Old Sun

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evenin' birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The sound of music in my ears

Distant bells
New mown grass smells so sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

And if you see, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evenin' birds are calling
Children's laughter in my ears
The last sunlight disappears

And if you see, don't make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a time so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling


Fearless

You say the hill's too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you'd like to see me try
Climbing

You pick the place and I'll choose the time
And I'll climb
The hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the treeline and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you said today

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns 'round
Frowning

And who's the fool who wears the crown?
And go down
in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fearlines in his brow
You look down, hear the sound of the faces in the crowd

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone


Flaming

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you

Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn
No fair, you can't hear me
But I can you

Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion
Too much, I won't touch you
But then I might

Screaming through the starlit sky
Travelling by telephone
Hey ho, here we go
Ever so high

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you


Free Four

One, two, free four
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in the gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

And life is a short warm moment
And death is a long cold rest
You get your chance to try
In the twinkling of an eye
Eighty years with luck or even less
So all aboard for the american tour
And maybe you'll make it to the top
But mind how you go
I can tell you `cause I know
You may find it hard to get off

But you are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son
He was buried like a mole in a foxhole
And everyone's still on the run
And who is the master of foxhounds
And who says the hunt has begun
Who calls the tune in the courtroom
And who beats the funeral drum
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
Shuffle in the gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die


Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert

"Oi...Get your filthy hands off my desert!"
"What 'e say?"

Brezhnev took Afghanistan.
Begin took Beirut.
Galtieri took the Union Jack.
And Maggie, over lunch one day,
Took a cruiser with all hands.
Apparently, to make him give it back


Give Birth To A Smile

Long live the child and the man
Long live the mother and the lad
The hills behind us and the sea
Reach out to welcome you and me
Valley deep and mountain tall
Lie upon the ground before us all
Strange are the colours of the turf
Heralding the rebirth of the earth
Gather all your energy and try
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
(Everytime you think about it)
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
(Hear me tellin' you)
Give birth to a smile
(Give birth to a smile)
Give birth to a smile
(Give birth, give birth)
Give birth to a smile
Give birth to a smile
(Every day of your life)
Give birth to a smile
(Give a little birth to a smile)
Give birth to a smile


Golden Hair

Lean out your window,golden hair
I heard you singing in the mindnight air
My book is closed, i read no more
Watching the fire dance, on the floor
I've left my book, i've left my room

For i heard you singing throught the gloom
Singing and singing, a merry air
Lean out your window, golden hair...


Goodbye Blue Sky

Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky

Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the
Promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue
Sky?

Did you see the frightened ones?
Did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye

The eleven fifteen from Newcastle is now approaching
The eleven eighteen arrival


Goodbye Cruel World

Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change
My mind
Goodbye.


Grantchester Meadows

Icy wind of nights be gone, this is not your domain
In the sky, a bird is heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow, I lay me down
All around me, golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow, I lay me down
All around me, golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea


Green Is The Colour

Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions overplayed
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind every time

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned


Have A Cigar

Come in here dear boy have a cigar
You're gonna go far,
You're gonna fly high
You're never gonna die,
You're gonna make it if you try
They're gonna love you

Well I've always had a deep respect
And I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic
That is really what I think
Oh, and by the way, which one's pink?

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy
We call it "Riding the gravy train"

We're just knocked out
We heard about the sell out
You've gotta get an album out
You owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count

Ev'ry body else is just green
Have you seen the charts?
It's a helluva start
It could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy
We call it "Riding the gravy train"


Hey You

Hey, you
Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?

Hey, you
Standing in the aisle
With itchy feet and fading smile
Can you feel me?

Hey, you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in, without a fight

Hey, you
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?

Hey, you
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?

Hey, you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Hey, you
Out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?

Hey, you
Out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?

Hey, you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall


High Hopes

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut?
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever


Ibiza Bar

I'm so afraid of the mistakes that I've made,
Breaking every time that I wake,
I feel like a cardboard and cut-out man,
So give me a time when the characters rhyme
and the storyline is kind.

I've aged an age since the first page,
I've lived every line that you wrote,
Take me down, take me down, from the shelf above your head,
And give me a time when the characters rhyme
and the storyline is kind.

And if I am left on the shelf like the rest,
And if the epilogue reads like a sad song.
Please pick-up your camera and use me again
And give me a time when the characters rhyme
and the storyline is kind.


If

If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late
And if I were a good man, I'd talk with you
More often than I do

If I were to sleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane, please don't put
Your wires in my brain

If I were the moon, I'd be cool
If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man, I'd understand
The spaces between friends

If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry
And if I go insane, will you still let
Me join in the game?

If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late again
If I were a good man, I'd talk with you
More often than I do


In The Flash

So ya thought ya might like to
Go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

I're got some bad news for you, sunshine
Pink ins't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're going to find out where you fans
Really stand

Are there any queers in the theater tonight
Get 'em up against the wall (get them up)
Now, there's one in the spotlight
He don't look right to me
Them up against the wall (get them)

Now, that one look jewish
And that one's a coon
Who let all this riffraff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint
And another with spots
If I had way, I'd have all of them shot

It Would Be So Nice

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet, sometime

Everybody wakes, and in the morning
Hot tea and can't stop yawning
Pass the butter please.
Have you ever read the Daily Standard?
Reading all about the plane that's landed
Upside down?

And no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime

Everybody cares about the weather
And everybody should know better
What a waste of time
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling
Living out a dream that sends them reeling
To a distant place

But no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime


Jugband Blues

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear
That I'm not here

And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red

And I'm wondering who could be writing this song

I don't care if the sun don't shine
And I don't care if nothing is mine
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you
I'll do my loving in the Winter

And the sea isn't green
And I love the Queen
And what exactly is a dream?
And what exactly is a joke?


Julia Dream

Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round

Julia dream
Dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Every night I turn the light out
Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I'm hiding?

Julia dream
Dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams

Will the misty master break me?
Will the key unlock my mind?
Will the following footsteps catch me?
Am I really dying?

Julia dream
Dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams


Keep Talking

For millions of years mankind lived just like animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination
We learned to talk

There's a silence surroundiing me
I can't seem to think straight
I'll sit in the corner
Where no one can bother me
I think I should speak now (why won't you talk to me)
But I can't seem to speak now (you never talk to me)
My words won't come out right (what are you thinking)
I feel like I'm drowning (what are you feeling)
I'm feeling weak now (why won't you talk to me)
But I can't show my weakness (you never talk to me
I sometimes wonder (what are you thinking)
Where do we go from here (what are you feeling)

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Why won't you talk to me (I feel like I'm drowning)
You never talk to me (you know I can't breathe now)
What are you thinking (we're going nowhere)
What are you feeling (we're going nowhere)
Why won't you talk to me
You never talk to me
What are you thinking
Where do we go from here

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking


Late Night

When I woke up today
and you weren't there to play
then I wanted to be with you
when you showed me your eyes
whispered love at the skies
then I wanted to stay with you
inside me I feel alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be
a very special thing to me...

When I lay still at night seeing
stars high and light
then I wanted to be with you
when the rooftops shone dark
all alone (I) saw a spark
spark of love just to stay with you
inside me I feel alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be
a very special thing to me...

If I mention your name
turn around on a chain
then the sky opens for you
when we grew very tall
when I saw you so small
then I wanted to stay with you
inside me I feel alone and unreal
and the way you kiss will always be
a very special thing to me...


Learning To Fly

Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses real
A fatal attraction holding me fast how
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue tied and twisted, just an earth bound misfit I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Friction lock - set
Mixture - rich
Propellers - fully forward
Flaps - set - 10 degrees
Engine gauges and suction - check

Mixture set to maximum percent - recheck
Flight instruments
Altimeters - check both
[Garbled word] - on
Navigation lights - on
Strobes - on
Confirm 3-8-Echo ready for departure
(Hello again, this is now 129. 4)
129. 4. It's to go
(You may commence your takeoff, winds over 10 knots)
3-8-Echo
Easy on the brakes. Take it easy. Its gonna roll this time
Just hand the power gradually, and it

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, A state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I


Let's Roll Another One

Oh my girl fading in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I'm high! Don't try to spoil the fun
Go cry or I'll have another one 

Ooh don't touch me child
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frail 

Ooh don't talk to me
Please, just walk with me
Please, you know I'm feeling frail 

It's true sun's shining very bright
It's you I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream tastes good if you eat it right
Ice cream tastes good if you treat it right 

Ooh don't talk to me
Please, you know you drive me wild
Please, you know I'm feeling frail 

Oh my girl fading in the sun
Go buy a candy and a currant bun
I'm high don't try to spoil the fun
Go cry or I'll have another one


Let There Be More Light

Far, far, far away, way
People heard him say, say
I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day
Something will be done
Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Now, now, now is the time, time
Time to be, be, be aware
Carter's father saw him there
And knew the Rhull revealed to him
The glowing soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my, something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me
The outer lock rolls slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was lucy in the sky

Oh, oh, did you ever know, know
Never ever will they
I cannot say
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
The psychic emanations fly


Lost For Words

I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in the cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralyzed
I thought that everything else would just wait

While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night

To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
Because there'll be no safety in numbers
When the Right One walks out of the door

Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door

So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can't win


Louder Than Words

We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do

With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name

It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words

The strings bend and slide
As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive

It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words

Louder than words
This thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse
Louder than words
Louder than words


Lucifer Sam

Lucifer Sam, siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side
That cat's something I can't explain

Jennifer Gentle you're a witch
You're the left side
He's the right side
That cat's something I can't explain

Lucifer go to sea
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat
Somewhere, anywhere
That cat's something I can't explain

At night prowling sifting sand
Hiding around on the ground
He'll be found when you're around
That cat's something I can't explain


Lucy Leave

Leave, when I ask you to leave, Lucy
Please, far away from me, Lucy
Oh, go little girl
Seen, is (oh so) broken up about you, Lucy
Mean, treat me and done me harm, Lucy
Been, in love with you and your charms, Lucy
Oh, go little girl
I'm in love with you, Lucy

You got my heart
You got my heart, oh no!
You tear me apart
You just won't let me go
You hold on so tight, so tight I just can't breath
Now Lucy leave, Lucy

Leave, when I ask you to leave, little girl
Please, far away from me, little girl
Yeah! go little girl
Seen, is (oh so) broken up about you, Lucy
Yeah!
Go.

Matilda Mother (2010 Mix)

There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes, and jam
And slices of delicious ham

Oh Mother, tell me more!

Why‚Äôd 'ya have to leave me there
hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They‚Äôre scribbly black and everything shines

The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did

In finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
and summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade

For all the time spent in that room
The doll‚Äôs house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

Oh Mother, tell me more!
Tell me more!

Aaah
Aaah
Aaah


Matilda Mother

There was a king who ruled the land
His majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showers silver on the people
Oh, Mother, tell me more

Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything shines

Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes, they did

For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high on
Clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh, Mother, tell me more
Tell me more
Ah
Ah
Ah


Mc Atmos

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
Some sunny day

Good evening.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Earl's Court.
My name is Gary Yudman and we are going to have a great show this evening.
The band is backstage and will be ready to go in just a few minutes.
Before the show begins the house management would like to request
just a few things.
First, please no fireworks.
Also, no flash cameras.
And any unauthorized audio or video equipment found being used
may be confiscated. So please save yourself a lot of hassle.
Well I think the band is almost ready to go now.

No, no. Not quite yet.

One thing I would like to point out.
Upon completion of the show tonight -


Money

Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

New car, caviar, four star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit

I'm in the high-fidelity, first class travelling set
And I think I need a Learjet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today

But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away

(Yeah, I was in the right!
Yes, absolutely in the right!
I certainly was in the right!
Yeah, I was definitely in the right
That geezer was cruising for a bruising
Yeah!
Why does anyone do anything?
I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!
I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two
He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven
After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why
It wasn't coming up on freight eleven
It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out)

Mother

Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Mother, should I build the wall?

Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Is it just a waste of time?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Momma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Momma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Momma's gonna keep you right here under her wing

She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Momma's gonna keep baby cozy and warm

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Oh, baby, of course momma's gonna help build the wall

Mother, do you think she's good enough for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry
Momma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Momma won't let anyone dirty get through
Momma's gonna wait up until you get in
Momma will always find out where you've been
Momma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Oh, baby, you'll always be baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high?

Nightmare

The path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by
Apprehension creeping like a tube train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final cuplet rhyme
And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me

Butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in there's no where you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling colored photographs to magazines back home
And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
Suddenly it strikes you that they're moving into range
Doctor Strange is always changing size
And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline
Please wake me

And it's high time Cymbaline
It's high time Cymbaline


No Good Trying

It's no good trying to place your hand
where I can't see because I understand
that you're different from me
yes I can tell
that you can't be what you pretend
and you're rocking me backwards
and you're rocking towards the
red and yellow mane of a stallion horse.

It's no good trying to hold your love
where I can't see because I understand
that you're different from me
yes I can tell
that you can't be what you pretend
the caterpillar hood won't cover the head of you
know you should be home in bed.

It's no good holding your sequin fan
where I can't see because I understand
that you're different from me
yes I can tell
that you can't be what you pretend
yes you're spinning around and around in a car
with electric lights flashing very fast...

I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues.
Got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And I've got the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favorite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to
Ooooh Babe when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots.


Not Now John

Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese.
There's too many home fires burning
And not enough trees.
So fuck all that
We've go to get on with these.

Can't stop
Lose job
Mind gone
Silicon
Stockholm
What bomb
Get away
Pay day
Make hay
Break down
Need fix
Big six
Clickity click
Hold on
Oh no
Brrrrrrrrrring bingo!

Make 'em laugh.
Make 'em cry.
Make 'em dance in the aisles.
Make 'em pay.
Make 'em stay.
Make'em feel ok.

Not nah John
We've got to get on with the film show.
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow.
Who cares what it's about
As long as the kids go?
Not now John
Got to get on with the show.

Hang on John we've got to get on with this.
I don't know what it is
But it fits on here like.....
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed.
But now now John
I've got to get on with this.

Hold on John
I think there's something good on.
I used to read books but.....
It could be the news
Or some other abuse
Or it could be reusable shows.

Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily Japanese.
No need to worry about the Vietnamese.
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees.
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear
Maybe the Swedes.
We showed Argentina
Now let's go and show these.
Make us feel tough
And wouldn't Maggie be pleased?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah!

"s'cusi dove il bar"
(What?)
"se para collo pou eine toe bar
s'il vous plait ou est le bar"
(...say it in English!...)
"oi, where's the fucking bar John?"
(Oh, now you're talking!)"
"Oh! Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day
Down!"
"Go, Maggie!"
"Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now!"


Obscured By Clouds

Octopus

Trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro
you have no word
trip, trip to a dream dragon
hide your wings in a ghost tower
sails cackling at every plate we break
cracked by scattered needles
the little minute gong
coughs and clears his throat
madam you see before you stand
hey ho, never be still
the old original favorite grand
grasshoppers green Herbarian band
and the tune they play is "In Us Confide"
so trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro'
you have no word
Please leave us here
close our eyes to the octopus ride.
Isn't it good to be lost in the wood
isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
meant even less to me than I thought
with a honey plough of yellow prickly seeds
clover honey pots and mystic shining feed...
well, the madcap laughed at the man on the border
hey ho, huff the Talbot
"Cheat" he cried shouting kangaroo
it's true in their tree they cried
Please leave us here
close our eyes to the octopus ride.
The madcap laughed at the man on the border
hey ho, huff the Talbot
the winds they blew and the leaves did wag
they'll never put me in their bag
the seas will reach and always seep
so high you go, so low you creep
the wind it blows in tropical heat
the drones they throng on mossy seats
the squeaking door will always squeak
two up, two down we'll never meet
so merrily trip forgo my side
Please leave us here
close our eyes to the octopus ride.


On The Run

(Have your baggage and passport ready
And then follow the green line to customs and immigration
BA flight 215 to Rome, Cairo and Lagos)

(Live for today, gone tomorrow, that‚Äôs me)


On The Turning Away

On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won't understand
Don't accept that what's happening
Is just a case of others' suffering
Or you'll find that you're joining in
The turning away

It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting it's shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
And mesmerised as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It's not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there'll be
No more turning away?


One In a Million

Would you like to be one in a million?
Would you like to be one in five?
Would you like to know all the hidden meaning?
Before they tell you you've run out of time
Would you like to be one in a million?
Would you like to be one in five?
When they tell you you ain't going nowhere
When they tell you you can't live your life.
(repeat one of the verses...)


One Of My Turns

["Oh my God, what a fabulous room!
Are all these your guitars?
This place is bigger than our apartment.
Uh, can I get a drink of water?
Do you want some? Huh?
Woah! Look at this tub!
Wanna take a baaath?!
What are you watchen'?
Hello? Are you feelin' okay?"]

Day after day, love turns grey.
Like the skin of a dying man.
Night after night, we pretend it's all right.
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder
and nothing is very much fun any more.
And I can feeeeeel
one of my turns coming on.
I feeeeeel
cold as razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum.

Run to the bedroom ..
In the suitcase on the left you'll find my favourite axe.
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase..
One of my bad days...
Would you like to watch T. V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would you, would you like to see me try?

Oh! Oh no!

Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?


One Of The Few

When you're one of the few to land on your feet
What do you do to make ends meet?
Teach
Make them mad, make them sad, make them add two and two
Make them me, make them you, make them do what you want them to
Make them laugh, make them cry, make them lay down and die


One Of These Days

One of these days
I'm going to cut you into little pieces


One Slip

A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend

I will, I will she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
The one regret, you will never forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight
One slip ... One slip


Opel

On a distant shore, miles from land
stands the ebony totem in ebony sand
a dream in a mist of gray...
on a far distant shore...

The pebble that stood alone
and driftwood lies half buried
warm shallow waters sweep shells
so the cockles shine...

A bare winding carcass, stark
shimmers as flies scoop up meat, an empty way...!!
dry tears...!!
crisp flax squeaks tall reeds
make a circle of gray in a summer way
around man
stood on ground

I'm trying
I'm trying to find you
To find you
I'm living, I'm giving
To find you, To find you
I'm living, I'm living
I'm trying, I'm giving


Outside The Wall

All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall
Some hand in hand
Some gathering together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists
Make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad buggers
Wall


Paintbox

Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink

What a way to spend that evening!
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been far away
Away - away - away - away - away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do?
I can't think what to say
She'll see through anyway
Anyway - anyway - anyway - anyway - anyway

Out of the front door I go
Traffic moving rather slow - arriving late
There she waits looking very angry
As cross as she can be
Be - be - be - be - be

Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget


Paranoid Eyes

Button your lip. Don't let the shield slip
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
You can hide, hide, hide
"I'll tell you what, I'll give you three blacks, and play you for five"
"Ta! You was unlucky there son"
"Time gentleman!"
Behind paranoid eyes

You put on your brave face and slip over the road for a jar
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd
You can hide, hide, hide
Behind petrified eyes

You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory
Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high
And you hide, hide, hide
Behind brown and mild eyes


Party Sequence

Pigs (Three Different Ones)

Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are
You well heeled big wheel, ha ha charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head head down in the pig bin
Saying: Keep on digging
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find?
When you're down in the pig mine
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry

Bus stop rat bag, ha ha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag, ha ha charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hat pin
And you're good fun with a hand gun
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh
But you're really a cry

Hey, you, Whitehouse
Ha ha charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Ha ha charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?

You gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside
Mary, you're nearly a treat
Mary, you're nearly a treat
But you're really a cry


Pigs On The Wing (Part 1)

If you didn't care
What happened to me

And I didn't care
For you

We would zig-zag our way
Through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame

And watching for pigs on the wing


Pigs On The Wing (Part 2)

You know that I care
What happens to you

And I know that you care
For me too

So I don't feel alone or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing


Pigs On The Wing (part I)

If you didn't care what happened to me,
And I didn't care for you,
We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain,
Occasionally glancing up through the rain,
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wing


Pigs On The Wing (Part II)

You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone
Or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe
To bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing


Point Me At The Sky

Hey, Eugene
This is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me
And hide with me, baby

Isn't it strange
How little we change
Isn't it sad we're insane
Playing the games that we know and in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and

Pointing to the cosmic glider
Pull this plastic glider higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, This is my last good-bye

Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in

People pressing on might say
It's something that I hate to say
I'm slipping down to eat the ground
A little refuge on my brain

Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly

And all we've got to say to you is good-bye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's good-bye
Nobody cry, it's good-bye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, good-bye


Poles Apart

Did you know... it was all going to go so wrong for you
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me
Why did we tell you then
You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes

Hey you... did you ever realise what you'd become
And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know

I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes

Raving And Drooling

Raving and drooling I fell on his neck with a scream
He had a whole lotta terminal shock in his eyes
That's what you get for pretending the rest are not real

Babbling and snapping at far away flies
He will zig zag his way back through memories of boredom and pain

How does it feel to be empty and angry and spaced
Split up the middle between the illusion of safety in numbers
and the fist in your face


Remember A Day

Remember a day before today
A day when you were you young
Free to play alone with time
Evening never came
Sing a song that can't be sung
Without the morning's kiss
Queen - you shall be it if you wish
Look for your king
Why can't we play today
Why can't we stay that way

Climb your favorite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away
Why can't we reach the sun
Why can't we blow the years away
Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember


Round and Around

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?

A man who ran: A child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of forge, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best

And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look

A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run it's course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun


Run Like Hell

Run, run, run, run
You better make your face up in
Your favorite disguise
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
When the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door
You better run

Run, run, run, run
You better run all day
And run all night
And keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside. And if you're
Takin' your girlfriend
Out tonight
You better park the car
Well out of sight
'Cos if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box
You better run


San Tropez

As I reach for a peach
Slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez.
Breakin' a stick
with a brick on the sand.
Ridin' a wave
In the wake of an old sedan.

Sleepin' alone in the
Drone of the darkness,
Scratched by the sand that
Fell from my love,
Deep in my dreams and I
Still hear her callin'
"If you're alone,
I'll come home."

Backward and homebound,
The pigeon, the dove,
Gone with the wind
And the rain, on an airplane.
Owning a home
With no silver spoon,
I'm drinking champagne
Like a good tycoon.

Sooner than wait for
A break in the weather,
I'll gather my far-flung
Thoughts together.
Speeding away
On the wind to a new day.
And if you're alone
I'll come home.

And I pause for a while
By a country style
And listen to the things they say.
Diggin' for gold
With a hoe in my hand.
Open a book
Take a look at the way things stand.

And you're leading me down
To the place by the sea.
I hear your soft voice
Calling to me.
Making a date for
Later by phone
And if you're alone
I'll come home.


Scarecrow

The black and green scarecrow
As ev'ryone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat
Ans straw everywhere
He didn't care...
He stood in a field where barley grows
His head did no thinking his arms didn't move
Except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground
He stood in a field where barley grows
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate
'Cause life's not unkind
He doesn't  mind
He stood in a field where barley grows.


Scream Thy Last Scream

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam, blam, your pointers, point your pointers
Wattle with apples to granchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing buffles on all fours
Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket

Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter
Flat top supposes, Moses, hoses
Hiddle and Diddle are sitting back
Watching the telly for all hours
(Telly time)
Fling your arms madly, old lady with a daughter

Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket
Blam, blam, your pointers, point your pointers
Wattle with apples to granchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing buffles on all fours
Scream thy last scream, old woman with a casket


Seabirds

Mighty waves come crashing down, 
The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye 
Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind, 
is calling sailors to the deep 
But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear 
Surf is high an' the sea is awash 
An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads 
Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun 
That was hot to touch 
And the sea was emerald green 
I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear 
And I can see you smile 
Surf comes rushing up the beach 
Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall
Catfish dappled silver flashing 
Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep


Seamus

I was in the kitchen
Seamus (that's the dog) was outside
Well, I was in the kitchen
Seamus, my old hound, was outside
Well you know the sun was sinkin' slowly
But my old hound dog sat right down and cried


See Emily Play

Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily, Emily

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may

See-Saw

Marigolds are very much in love, but he doesn't mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the seas or land
All the way she smiles
She goes up while he goes down, down
Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn't know so then
She goes up while he goes down, down
Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave
Another time, another day

She'll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon

Picking up weeds, she hasn't got the time to care
All can see he's not there
She grows up for another man, and he's down
Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave
Another time, another day
Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave


Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun

Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting
Set the controls for the heart of the Sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness
Waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
Set the controls for the heart of the Sun

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his questions to Heaven
Whether the Sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving
Set the controls for the heart of the Sun

The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun
The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun
The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun
The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun
The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun
The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun
The heart of the Sun, the heart of the Sun


Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered

Aye an' a bit of Mackeral settler rack and ruin
Ran it doon by the haim, 'ma place
Well I slapped me and I slapped it doon in the side
And I cried, cried, cried

The fear a fallen down taken never back the raize and then craig
Marion
Get out wi' ye Claymore out mi pocket a' ran doon, doon the
Middin stain
Picking the fiery horde that was fallen around ma feet
Never he cried, never shall it ye get me alive
Ye rotten hound of the burnie crew. Well I snatched fer the
Blade o my
Claymore cut and thrust and I fell doon before him round his
Feet

Aye! A roar he cried frae the bottom of his heart that I would
Nay fall
But as dead, dead as 'a can be by his feet; de ya ken?

And the wind cried Mary

Thank you


Sheep

Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trotten corridors, into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green, he leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives, He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, he hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old


Shine On You Crazy Diamond (parts I-V)

Remember when you were young?
You shone like the sun
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on, you crazy diamond

You were caught in the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom
Blown on, the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend
You martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome

With random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper
You prisoner, and shine!


Shine On You Crazy Diamond (parts VI-IX)

Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far

Shine on, you crazy diamond

Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there

Shine on, you crazy diamond

And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion
And shine


Signs Of Life

When the child like view of the world went, nothing replaced it...nothing replaced it...nothing replaced it...
I do not like being asked to.....I do not like being asked to... I do not like being asked to....

Other people replaced it
Someone who knows

(Instrumental)


Sorrow

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land.
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
It's not enough, it's not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river rolls

He talks to the river of lost love and dedication
Silently replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be

There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And the silence speaks so much louder that words,
Of promises broken


Southampton Dock

They disembarked in 45
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line.
Gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with the hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial Knifes.
But now
She stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock clings
To her wet body in the rain.
In quiet desperation knuckles
White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again.

And still the dark stain spreads between
His shoulder blades.
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves.
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made.
But in the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut.


Speak To Me

(I've been mad for fucking years
Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks
Been working me buns off for bands)

(I've always been mad, I know I've been mad
Like the most of us have
Very hard to explain why you're mad
Even if you're not mad)


Stay

Stay and help me to end the day
And if you don't mind we'll break a bottle of wine
Stick around and maybe we'll put one down
Cause I wanna find what lies behind those eyes
Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold

I rise looking through my morning eyes
Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain to try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you goodbye
Morning dues newborn day
Midnight blue turned to gray

Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold


Stop

Stop
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show
And I'm waiting here in this cell
Because I have to know
Have I been guilty all this time


Summer '68

Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello

I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I came today and lost a bloody year

And I would like to know

How do you feel? (How do you feel?)
How do you feel? (How do you feel?)

Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of ninety-five

My friends are lying in the Sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man

Just you let me know

How do you feel? (How do you feel?)
How do you feel? (How do you feel?)

Goodbye to you
Charlotte Pringle's due
I've had enough for one day


Swan Lee (Silas Lang)

Swan Lee got up at the Running Foot pow-wow,
heading from the fire to his waiting canoe.
Chattering Squaw untied the wigwam door,
the chief blew smoke rings two by two!

The land in silence stands...

Swan Lee, his boat by the bank in the darkness,
loosened the rope in the creek is entwined.
A feather from the wing of a wild young eagle,
pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find

The land in silence stands

Swan Lee paddled on from the land of his fathers,
his eyes scanned the undergrowth on either side.
From the shore hung a hot, heavy, creature infested
tropic, Swan Lee had a bow by his side

The land in silence stands

Swan Lee kept time, half on land, half on water,
Grizzly bear and raccoon his fare.
He followed his ears to the great water fall,
Swan Lee knew deep down that his squaw was there!

The land in silence stands....

Suddenly the rush of the mighty great thunder,
confronted Swan Lee as his song he sang,
In the dawn, with his squaw, he was battling homewards
It was all written down by Long Silas Lang.

The land in silence stands...
The land in silence stands...
The land in silence stands.

Take It Back

Her love rains down on me as easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness; &amp; the earth was on fire

She could take it back, she might take it back some day

So I spy on her, I have lied to her, I make promises I cannot
keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take
(And) I push her to the limit to see if she will break

She might take it back, she could take it back some day

Now I had seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It's easy to ignore them God knows I've tried
All of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide

She Could take it back, she will take it back some day

She Could take it back, she will take it back some day

She will take it back; She will take it back some day


Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk

Doctor doctor!
I'm in bed
Achin' head
Gold is lead
Choke on bread
Underfed
Gold is lead
Jesus bled
Pain is red
Are goon
Grow go
Greasy spoon
You swoon
June bloom

Music seems to help the pain
Seems to cultivate the brain.
Doctor kindly tell your wife that
I'm alive - flowers thrive - realize - realize
Realize.


Talkin‚Äô Hawkin‚Äô

Speech has allowed the communication of ideas
Enabling human beings to work together
To build the impossible

Mankind's greatest achievements
Have come about by talking
Our greatest hopes could become
Reality in the future

With the technology at our disposal
The possibilities are unbounded
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking'

The Division Bell (complete)

Cluster One

What Do You Want From Me
As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears
What do you want
What do you want from me
Should I sing until I can't sing any more
Play these strings till my fingers are raw
You're so hard to please
What do you want from me

Do you think that I know something you don't know
What do you want from me
If I don't promise you the answers would you go
What do you want from me
Should I stand out in the rain
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you
I'm not the one you need
What do you want from me

You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
Anything you want

You can own everything you see
Sell your soul for complete control
Is that really what you need

You can lose yourself this night
See inside there is nothing to hide
Turn and face the light

What do you want from me 

Poles Apart
Did you know... it was all going to go so wrong for you
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me
Why did we tell you then
You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose the light in your eyes

Hey you... did you ever realize what you'd become
And did you see that it wasn't only me you were running from
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away fromme
And did you know...

I never thought that you'd lose the light in your eyes 

Marooned


A Great Day for Freedom
On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived

On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone

Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their blooded hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residue slipped away... slipped away 

Wearing the Inside Out
From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn't recognise I'd become
No more than alive I'd barely survive
In a word... overrun

Won't hear a sound (He's curled into the corner)
From my mouth (But still the screen is flickering)
I've spent too long (With and endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out (... curse the place)
My skin is cold (In a sea of random images)
To the human touch (The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart's (Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much

I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don't even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

I'm creeping back to life
My nervous system all awry
I'm wearing the inside out

Look at him now
He's paler somehow
But he's coming around
He's starting to choke
It's been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth

And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again

I'm holding out (He's standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he'll)
Have blown away (... curse the place)
I'm with you now (He's torn in all directions)
Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)
Ourselves again 

Take it Back
Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing it sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness, the earth was on fire

She could take it back,s he might take it back some day

So I spy on her, I lie to her, I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I cantake
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break

She might take it back, she could take it back some day

Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It's eay to ignore them and G-d knows I've tried
All of this temptation, it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn't see the danger or hear the rising tide

She can take it back, she will take it back some day

She can take it back, she will take it back some day

She will take it back, she will take it back some day 

Coming Back to Life
Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun

Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistable pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight... into the shining son 

Keep Talking
For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals
Then something happened which unleashed the power of ourimagination
We learned to talk

There's a silence surrounding me
I can't seem to think straight
I'll sit in the corner
No one can bother me
I think I should speak now (Why won't you talk to me)
I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me)
My words won't come out right (What are you thinking)
I feel like I'm drowning (What are you feeling)
I'm feeling weak now (Why won't you talk to me)
But I can't show my weakness (You never talk to me)
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking)
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling)
It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Why won't you alk to me (I feel like I'm drowning)
You never talk to me (You know I can't breathe now)
What are you thinking (We're going nowhere)
What are you feeling (We're going nowhere)
Why won't you talk to me
You never talk to me
What are you thinking
Where do we go from here

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking 

Lost for Words
I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralysed
I thought that everythign else would just wait

While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision, reality fades
Like shadows into the night

To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
Because there'll be no safety in numbers
When the Right One walks out of the door

Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over your door

So I opened my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just can't win 

High Hopes
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut?

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to theground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Forever and ever


The Dogs Of War

Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know the web we weave

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world
One world

Invisible transfers, long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world
One world

The dogs of war don't negotiate
The dogs of war won't capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world
One world


The Final Cut

Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiralling down to the hole in the ground where I hide.

If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall,
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall.

There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines.
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?

And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut.
"Hello? Listen, I think I've got it. Okay, listen its a HaHa!"


The Fletcher Memorial Home

Take all your overgrown infants away somewhere
And build them a home, a little place of their own.
The Fletcher Memorial
Home for Incurable tyrants and kings

And they can appear to themselves every day
On closed circuit T.V.
To make sure they're still real
It's the only connection they feel
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Reagan and Haig
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher and Paisly
"Hello, Maggie!"
Mr. Brezhnev and party
"Who's the bald chap?"
The ghost of McCarthy
The memories of Nixon
"Goodbye!"
And now, adding color, a group of anonymous latin-american Meat packing glitterati

Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?
They can polish their medals and sharpen their
Smiles and amuse themselves playing games for awhile
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead

Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye
With their favorite toys
They'll be good girls and boys
In the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial wasters of life and limb

Is everyone in?
Are you having a nice time?
Now the final solution can be applied


The Gnome

I want to tell you a story
About a little man
If I can
A gnome named Grimble Crumble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine

He wore a scarlet tunic,
A blue green hood,
It looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass
Fresh air at last
Wining, dining, biding his time
And then one day - hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Oooooooooomlay

Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good
Winding, finding places to go
And then one day - hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Oooooooooomlay
Ooooooooooooooomlay


The Gold It's In The...

Come on, my friends let's make for the hills
They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills
You can get your hands on whatever we find
'Cause I'm only comin' 'long for the ride
Well, you go your way, I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time

Ev'rybody's searching for something they say
I'll get my kicks on the way
Over the mountain, across the seas
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names

Faces of people and places don't change
All I have to do is close my eyes
To see the sea gulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I want to tell you, all I want to say
Is count me in on the journey
Don't expect me to stay

Why should I be frightened of dying?

The Gunner's Dream

Floating down through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now.
In the space between the heavens
and in the corner of some foreigh field
I had a dream.
I had a dream.
Goodbye Max.
Goodbye mom.
After the service when you're walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold november air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream.

A place to stay
"Oi! A real one ..."
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And whats more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door.
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no-one kills the children anymore.
And no one kills the children anymore.

Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane.
In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight.
What's done is done.
We cannot just write off his final scene.
Take heed of his dream.
Take heed.


The Happiest Days Of Our Lives

(You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddy!)

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers
Who would hurt the children any way they could
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives


The Hero's Return (part. 2)

Jesus christ, i might as well be dead
I can't see how dangerous
It must feel to me
Training human cogs for the machine
Without some shell-shocked lunatic like me

Bombarding their still soft shells

With sticks and stones
That were lying around
In the pile of unspeakable feelings i'd found

When i turned back the stone
Turned over the stone
Of my own disappointment back home


The Hero's Return

Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about?
Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape.
When I was their age all the lights went out.
There was no time to whine or mope about.
And even now part of me flies over
Dresden at angels one five.
Though they'll never fathom it behind my
Sarcasm desperate memories lie.

Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good.
'Cause that's the only time that I can really speak to you.
And there is something that I've locked away
A memory that is too painful
To withstand the light of day.

When we came back from the war the banners and
Flags hung on everyone's door.
We danced and we sang in the street and
The church bells rang.
But burning in my heart
My memory smoulders on
Of the gunners dying words on the intercom.

The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot

He's the little boy 
That Santa Claus 
Forgot
And goodness knows 
He didn't want a lot
He sent 
A note to Santa 
For some soldiers 
And a drum
It broke 
His little heart 
When he found 
Santa didn't come

In the street 
He envies 
All those lucky boys
Then wanders home 
To last year's 
Broken toys
I'm so sorry 
For that laddie 
He hasn't got 
A daddy
The little boy 
That Santa Claus 
Forgot

I'd like 
To tell you 
About a boy 
Who lives 
Across the way
To this little guy
Well, Christmas 
Is just another day
So tell you 
Kids this story 
And hug them close 
And hold them near
And hope 
That little boy 
Will have 
A real Christmas 
This time next year

In the street 
He envies all 
Those lucky boys
Then wanders home 
To last year's 
Broken toys
I'm so sorry 
For that laddie 
He hasn't got 
A daddy
The little boy 
That Santa Claus 
Forgot


The Narrow Way (part I)




The Narrow Way (part II)




The Narrow Way Part III

Following the path as it leads toward 
The darkness in the north 
Weary stranger's faces show their sympathy 
They've seen that hope before 

And if you want to stay for a little bit 
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
For you the night is beckoning 
And now you can't delay 
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way 

Mystery swelling, creatures crawling 
Hear the roar ger louder in your ears 
You know the folly was your own 
But the force behind can't conquer all you fears 

And if you want to stay for a little bit 
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
For you the night is beckoning and you know 
And now you can't delay 
You hear the night birds calling you 
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way 

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning 
Perhaps a day will come when the match for me the
curlers past warning 

And if you want to stay for a little bit 
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit 
For you the night is beckoning 
And now you can't delay 
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
And you must you realize be on your way


The Nile Song

I was standing by the Nile
When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while

Light tears wept like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the island in the sun

I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye

She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down


The Post War Dream

(Announced plans to build a nuclear fallout shelter at Peterborough in Cambridgeshire)
(Three high court judges have cleared the way)
(It was announced today, that the replacement for the Atlantic Conveyor the container  ship lost in the Falklands conflict wouldbe built in Japan, a spokesman for)
(Moving in. They say the third world countries, like Bolivia,which produce the drug are suffering from rising violence)

Tell me true, tell me why, was Jesus crucified
Is it for this that Daddy died?
Was it for you? Was it me?
Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
If it wasn't for the nips
Being so good at building ships
The yards would still be open on the Clyde
And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide
What have we done, Maggie what have we done?
What have we done to England?
Should we shout, should we scream
What happened to the post war dream?
Oh Maggie, Maggie what have we done?


The Return Of The Son Of Nothing

Planets meeting face to face
Bound to the air of light, how sweet!
If purposely we might embrace
The perfect union deep in space

Ever might this once relent
And give us leave to shine as one
Our two lights shining better than one light can

And in that longing to be one
The parting "suns" shine as one
I see you've got to travel on
And on and on, around the sun

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And i am you and what i see is me

And do i take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best i can

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
And no one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless everyday you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise

And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings

A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
And no one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun


The Show Must Go On

Oooh Ma Oooh Pa
Must the show go on

Oooh Pa take me home
Oooh Ma let me go

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul
Am I too old is it too late

Oooh Ma Oooh Pa
Where has the feeling gone?

Oooh Ma Oooh Pa
Will I remember the songs?
Oooooh aah the show must go on.


The Thin Ice

Momma loves her baby
And daddy loves he too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh, babe
Ooh, baby blue
Ooh, babe

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice


The Trial

Good morning, worm, your honor!
The crown will plainly show the prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster!

I always said he'd come to no good in the end, your honor
If they'd let me have my way I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today?

Crazy, toys in the attic
I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away

(Crazy, toys in the attic
He is crazy!)

You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did
But no! You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
Just five minutes, worm, your honor
Him and me, alone

Babe!

Come to mother, baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'lud, I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honour
Let me take him home

Crazy, over the rainbow
I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in

(Crazy, over the rainbow
He is crazy!)

The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate!

(Come on, judge! Shit on him!)

Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!

Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!


Things Left Unsaid

We certainly are underspoken and understanding
But there's a lot of things unsaid as well
We shout and argue and fight, and work it on out


Time

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time has gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells


Two Of A Kind

Open your eyes and don't be blind
Can't you see we're two of a kind?
I've got to say this, I hope you don't mind
I love you, we're two of a kind

Just ask yourself and you will find
We go together, we're two of a kind
No use protesting, be resigned
Baby you know, we're two of a kind

I knew it when I saw you
I felt it a little more when
I talked with you at first
All my blues dispersed
I couldn't disguise
My complete surprise
When you were feeling it too
I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you...

Open your eyes and don't be blind
Can't you see we're two of a kind?
I've got to say this, I hope you don't mind
I love you, we're two of a kind


Two Suns In The Sunset

In my rear view mirror, the Sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come

The rusty wire that holds the cork
That keeps the anger in
Gives way
And suddenly, it's day again
The Sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset
Hmm
Could be the human race is run

Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck
(Oh no!)
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear
And you'll never hear their voices
(Daddy, daddy!)
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

And as the windshield melts
And my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally, I understand the feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds
Foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

And now the weather
Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east
With an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius


Up The Khyber

Instrumental


Us And Them

Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

Forward, he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who?
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round and round

Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

(I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion, but really
I mean, good manners don't cost nothing do they?)

Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

Out of the way it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died


Vegetable Man

In yellow shoes 
I get the blues,
So I walk the street with my plastic feet
with blue velvet trousers make me feel pink.
Theres a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers

In my paisley shirt,
I look a jerk,
and my turquoise wasitcoat is quite outta sight.
But oh, oh, my haircut looks so bad....
Vegetable man! Where are you?

So I change my gear,
and I bugger my knees
and I cover them up with the latest cuts
My pants and socks are all in a box
It does take long to find darn old socks
The watch, 
black watch, 
my watch 
with a black face
and a date in a little hole

and all the luck,
its what I got,
Its what I wear,
Its what you see,
It must be me,
Its what I am!
Vegetable man! Where are you?

Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Hah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah - oh!
I've been looking all over the place
for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere
It just ain't anywhere.

Vegetable man, Vegetable man,
Vegetable man. Vegetable man,
Vegetable man, Vegetable man,

He's the kind of fella you just gotta see if you can,
Vegetable man.


Vera

Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day
Vera! Vera!
What has become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do ?


Waiting For The Worms

Eins, zwei, drei, Alle!

Ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye cruel world, it's over
Walk on by
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows
And kick in their doors
Waiting for the final solution
To strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers
And fire the ovens
Waiting for the queers and the coons
And the reds and the jews
Waiting to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms


Wearing The Inside Out

From morning to night I stayed out of sight
Didn't recognize I'd become
No more than alive I'd barely survive
In a word... Overrun

Won't hear a sound
(He's curled into the corner)
From my mouth
(But still the screen is flickering)
I've spent too long
(With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out
(Curse the place)
My skin is cold
(In a sea of random images)
To the human touch
(The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart's
(Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much

I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don't even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by the light I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile

I'm creeping back to life
My nervous system all awry
I'm wearing the inside out

Look at him now
He's paler somehow
But he's coming around
He's starting to choke
It's been so long since he spoke
Well he can have the words right from my mouth

And with these words I can see
Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name
Now we can hear ourselves again

I'm holding out
(He's standing on the threshold)
For the day
(Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds
(And hurled into the furnace he'll)
Have blown away
(Curse the place)
I'm with you now
(He's torn in all directions)
Can speak your name
(And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear
(Waiting for the flames to break)
Ourselves again


Welcome To The Machine

Welcome, my son, welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright, we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and scouting for boys
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

Welcome, my son, welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's alright, we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the steak bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine


What Do You Want From Me

As you look around this room tonight 
Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
Do you want my blood, do you want my tears 
What do you want 
What do you want from me 
Should I sing until I can't sing any more 
Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
You're so hard to please 
What do you want from me 

Do you think that I know something you don't know 
What do you want from me 
If I don't promise you the answers would you go 
What do you want from me 
Should I stand out in the rain 
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you 
I'm not the one you need 
What do you want from me 

You can have anything you want 
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water 
Anything you want 

You can own everything you see 
Sell your soul for complete control 
Is that really what you need 

You can lose yourself this night 
See inside there is nothing to hide 
Turn and face the light 

What do you want from me


When The Tigers Broke Free

It was just before dawn
One miserable morning in black forty-four
When the Forward Commander was told to sit thight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the Generals gave thanks
As the others ranks
Held back the enemy tanks for a while
And the Anzio Bridgehead was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

And kind old King George
Sent Mother a note
When he heard the Father was gone
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll
With gold leaf and all
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs
Hidden away
And my eyes still grow damp
To remember His Majesty
Signed with own rubber stamp

It was dark all around
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company C
They were all left behind
Most of them dead
The rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command took my Daddy from me


When You're In

Instrumental


Wish You Were Here

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell?
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish
How I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here


Wolfpack

Howling the pack in formation appears
Diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
Waving us back in formation
The pack in formation
Bowling they bat as a group
And the leader is seen so early
The pack on their backs, the fighters
Through misty the waving the pack in formation
Far reaching waves
On sight, shone right
I lay as if in surround
All enmeshing, hovering
The milder i gaze
All the animals laying trail
Beyond the bough winds
Mild the reflecting electricity eyes
Tears, the life that was ours
Grows sharper and stronger away and beyond
Short wheeling - fresh spring
Gripped with blanched bones, moaned
Magnesium, proverbs and sobs
Howling the pack in formation appears
Diamonds and clubs, light misted fog, the dead
Waving us back in formation
The pack in formation


Wot's... Uh The Deal

Heaven sent the promised land
Looks all right from where I stand
'Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line
Because it's time
To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowin' in my soul
And I think I'm growing old
Flash the readies
Wots..uh the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel
Mile after mile stone after stone
You turn to speak but you're alone
Million miles from home you're on your own
So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowin' in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Fire bright by candlelight and her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again
Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out
Hear me shout
Come on in
What's the news? where you been?
'Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old


Yet Another Movie

One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?

A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best

And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look

A man in black on a snow white horse,
A pointless life has run its course,
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun


You Gotta Be Crazy

You gotta be crazy, you gotta be mean
You gotta keep your kids and your car clean
You gotta keep climbing, you gotta keep fit
You gotta keep smiling, you gotta eat shit

You gotta be small to be a big shot
You gotta eat meat to stay at the top
You gotta be trusted, gotta tell lies
You gotta be able to narrow your eyes

You gotta beleive they've gotta beleive you
You gotta appear easy to see through
Gotta be sure you look good on the TV
Gotta resemble a human being

You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder
Gonna get harder as you get older
Gotta fly south and hide in the sand
Gotta forget that you're gonna get cancer

And when you loose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone

And it's too late to loose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown
As you go down
Alone
Dragged down by the stone

Gotta be sure, you gotta be quick
Gotta divide the tame from the sick
Gotta keep some of us docile and fit
You gotta keep everyone burying this shit
You gotta get you started early
Processed by the time you're thirty
Work like fuck 'till you're sixty five
And then your time's your own until you die

I gotta admit to a lot of confusion
Pain in the head is the child of collusion
Gotta resist the creeping malaise
You gotta beleive in the way you get out of the maze
But you, you just keep on pretending
You can tell a sucker from a friend
But you still raise the knife to
Stranger, lover, friend and foe alike

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was sent out to play on his own
Who was raised on a diet of shame
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with bridle and bit

Who was given a seat in the stand
Who was forcing his way to the rails
Who was offered a place on the board
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone


Young Lust

I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Oh I need a dirty woman
Oh I need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock and roll refugee
Oh, babe, set me free

Oh I need a dirty woman
Oh I need a dirty girl
Oh I need a dirty woman
Oh I need a dirty girl


Your Possible Pasts

They flutter behind you your possible pasts,
Some brighteyed and crazy, some frightened and lost.
A warning to anyone still in command
[cattle truck noises]
"Ranks! Fire!"
Of their possible future, to take care.
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time.

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we shoud be closer?

She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign.
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs.
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand.
He said, "I was just a child then, now I'm only a man."

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?

By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad.
Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay.
And strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags.

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?



21st Century

All the Creatures
On the beaches
Making waves in a motion picture
Wont you keep this
In between us
Search and seizure, wake up venus

The dollar bill will
Mentally ill Bill
Mum and dad, take your "don't be sad" pill
Turn the screw and
Twist my language
Don't forsake me I'm contagious

There's a reason for the 21st Century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

It's my favourite
Combination
Coming down with the favoured nations
Deep rotation
Mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation

Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Like a Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
It's time to run this table

There's a reason for the 21st Century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

Read me your scripture now
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and i will twist it

Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it kiss it

Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Like a Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
It's time to run this table

Simple soldier
Hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her
Strangulation
Altercation
Oral sex and bird migration

There's a reason for the 21st Century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

There's a reason for the 21st Century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be


A Certain Someone

When it will come around
The wind that... will inspire

When will it make a sound
The sound... I desire

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something... that's true

Floating upstream I've seen
The spider and the snake
A trip without pause when
I saw... my mistake

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something... that's true

All my life... I have known who I am
A troubled man but I stand

All my life I have seen what it means
To be myself in this dream

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain someone... that's you


A Teenager In Love

Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cos I am so afraid
That we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll have to learn
The good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be the lonely one if you should say we're through

Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
Even you should say goodbye
I still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I be the lonely one if you should say we're through

Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you say goodbye
I still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?


Aeroplane

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

Looking in my own eyes hell-o
I can't find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rear view mirror
Looking in my rear view mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear! Have no fear!

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain

Sitting in my kitchen hey girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of Mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad
Sad like me!

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

Pleasure spiked with pain

Just one note
Could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from
The song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note
Could make me choke
One note that's not a lie
Just one note
Could cut my throat
One note could make me die

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane

That's spiked with pain

It's my aeroplane


After Hours

If you close the door
The night could last forever
Keep the sunshine out 
And say hello to never
All the people are laughing
And they're havin such fun
I wish it could happen to me
But if you close the door...
I'd never have to see the day again.


American Ghost Dance

Oh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peacable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

American ghost dance

A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive! He cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

American ghost dance

Apache Rose Peacock

Sittin' on a sack of beans
Sittin' down in New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans

Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks

Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Hannah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans

Oh, good brother, just when I tought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw

I saw a bird walkin' down the block
Name Apache Rose Peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock

Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans

A little boy came along
Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my willy

So I found her in the quarter
Good God, how I adored her
Oh, she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey

I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy wheater
I never met a girl that I like better

Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard

Apache Rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest ass on the goddamn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funcky ass meters
She has one of those built in heaters

I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy wheater
I never met a girl that I like better

Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it

Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right

Yes, my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans


Around The World

All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya'
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya'
'Bout the motha' fuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said: Hallelujah
Good God, girl! I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello, and then I say: I do

Come back baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride, step aside my Johnson
Yes I could in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say: I do

Where you want to go, who you want to be
What you want to do, just come with me
I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me girl, sitting in the Swiss mountains
Me, oh, My O, Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rocking Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife, 'cause life is beautiful

I know I know for sure
Ding deng dong dong ding deng dong dong ding deng
I know I know it¬¥s you
Ding deng dong dong ding deng dong dong ding deng

Mother Russia do not suffer, I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say: I do


Baby Appeal

On the city streets I got the tunes in my pocket
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister won't you hear my thoughts

Her pop said no but she just couldn't stop
The kid had a case of toddler rock

Well here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal

We serve those tots in the funk-o-meal
I'm overjoyed we have baby appeal

We stoke the fire we crank the heat
4 groove dog brothers funkin‚Äô out in the street
Rockin‚Äô up a storm when who do we meet
But the hop, skip, jump, bumpin‚Äô baby de beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know she called out her fleet

That's a serious sight I mean golly, gee whiz
I just can't tell you how much we dig
Rock out for those itty, bitty kids

Well here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal

Backwoods

Someone spilled blood many years ago
Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods
Where the Chuck Berries grow
Come your long tall
Daddies of a rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Spinning' down from the clouds
Like a tornado
Spinnin' out of control
Like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hittin' harder
Than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Mr Uplift Mofo - my man Bo Diddley
Hit sippin' a bottle of nickle ripple
Play the lickity split finger licking licks
For all you wicked city slick chicks

And all you nitty gritty hick
We'll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That's right
Because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That's right he'll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The Howling Wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can take me to your backwoods now

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods


Battleship

Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise

Battle ship battle ship

See the sailor boys dressed in blue
Cheer the change to make the news
Send the shell down the spiral groove
Bombs away it's a shakedown cruise Yeah

Battle ship battle ship


Behind The Sun

One day while bathing in the sea
My talking dolphin spoke to me
He spoke to me in symphony
From freedom's peace beneath the sea
He looked to me eyes full of love
Said yes we live behind the sun

Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun

The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound

Behind the sun

Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
The one who listens to the surf
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth
And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea

Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun

An island flying through the sky
One day your son might ask you why
And if your son should be a girl
She too might ask you of this world
The sun shines sweet upon your beach
And yes my dolphin loves to teach

Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun

The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound

Behind the sun


Bicycle Song

Here she comes in a suit and tie
Shepard's bush and a leopard's pie
She marching to the funky beat of
James Brown and his dancing feet
Gonna set your fish on fire
Pistol whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I'll pick you up yes it's a date

How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever moved me
Happy days but sad I'm facin
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Gotta a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Wanna smell your sunny face
Funny place but it's never a waste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends

How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention
Make it up makin you my business
A funny buttercup but I let her forgiveness
Happy days but sad I'm facin
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse


Black Cross

All I got is a Black Cross, 
And two crabs in my left eye, 
What you say you want you want, 
Like a lump in your right thigh. 

We're going left on right, 
And I don't want to see you again, 
Going left on right, 
And I don't wanna be your friend, 
We're going left on right, 
And I don't want to see you again, 
Going left on right, 
And I don't wanna be your friend. 

You the users of the wheel, 
Stink of oil and electric eels, 
Users of forbetten tools, 
We must be the fools. 

We're going left on right, 
And I don't want to see you again, 
Going left on right, 
And I don't wanna be your friend, 
We're going left on right, 
And I don't want to see you again, 
Going left on right, 
And I don't wanna be your friend. 

Cancel the world, 
Erase history, 
There is no future, 
As far as i can see, 

We're going left on right, 
And I don't want to see you again, 
Going left on right, 
And I don't wanna be your friend, 
We're going left on right, 
And I don't want to see you again, 
Going left on right, 
And I don't wanna be your friend.


Blackeyed Blonde

Pumpin' the blood through the heart of New Orleans
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy
You'd better leave her alone

Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl
She's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blonde, get down!

That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy
She'll clean your clock

A slick and sly spy
Stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr James Bond
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blonde, get down!


Blood Sugar Sex Magik

Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish?
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity, my affinity
I mingle with the gods, I mingle with devinity

Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimensions to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snowwhite throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice, a fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower, she must be moist

Blues For Meister

It's always half and half
I'm happy and I'm sad
Everything that's beautifull
Always kills me too
The highest I get up
Is the deepest I get down
You're up there with your life
That's why I gotta shout, shout,
...And then gotta shout, shout

Blues for Meister
You sweet little thing
Blues for Meister
I'm so sad I gotta sing
A cozy little kitty up 
sittin' on the couch
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby
I really miss you now
Well have some respect
For my cat
He got squashed by the wheel
Of a Cadillac
Well, me and my pussy
We lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico

Your food's still in the cupboard
Hangin' in its can
You used to love to eat it
Down
I'll always love you Meister
You were so good to me
There's nothing like you nowhere
As far as I can see


Bob

Well, my friend Bob's in jail today
His girlfriend is too
For stealing change for gasoline

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the brew
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob‚Ä¶

I met him on the boulevard, Hollywood and Vine
He said "you're gonna be a superstar"
I said "that's fine, sublime"
He loved my crime

But there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Hanky Late all thru the night
Blackest flag at dawn
A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong, that's wrong
Please be lifelong

'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob‚Ä¶
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Killing yourself, that would be an awesome oath
This song is so far away
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Remember our friendship

Stealing everything in the store
You know I want you to stay
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Friends fade away‚Ä¶

Well, my friend Bob's insane today
I know I am too
The mental patients laugh and cry

Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the brew
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob‚Ä¶


Brandy

To Di To Di To Di To Di

There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

There's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whisky and wine
The sailors say...

(Refr√£o)

Brandy, you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be, such a fine girl

Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

To Di To Di To Di To Di

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summers day - bearing gifts - from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
The harbor was his home...

(Refr√£o)

Brandy, you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

To Di To Di To Di To Di

Brandy used to watch his eyes
As he told his sailor stories
he could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

To Di To Di To Di To Di

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a slient town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say...

To Di To Di To Di To Di

Brandy, you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
But my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea

To Di To Di To Di To Di


Brave From Afar

Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when they tell you
They sell you
For your children
The shelter they're building

Prime time the perfect crime
Bow my head the AX we grind
Ruse cruise p's and q's
I got beat up by the evening news

Deep hits the media blitz
Lost my mind to keep my witts
Maintain the same old same
Goodbye Shiz and so long game

Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when they tell you
They sell you
For your children
The shelter they're building

Plain Jane the big campaign
The last detail has been restrained
Fraud fraud the lightning rod
When you see the sign time applaud

Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when they tell you
They sell you
For your children
The shelter they're building


Breaking The Girl

I am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go

She was a girl
Soft but strange
We were the two
Our lives rearranged

Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way

She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home

I don't know what, when or why
The twilight of love had arrived

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)

Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)


Brendan's Death Song

If I die before I get it done
Will you decide?
Take my words and turn them
Into signs they will survive
Because a long time ago
I knew not to deprive
It‚Äôs safe out there and now you‚Äôre everywhere
Just like the skies
You are love you are the love supreme
You are the rise
And when you hear this
You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs your jam
It‚Äôs your goodbye

Like I said
You know I‚Äôm almost dead
You know I‚Äôm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He‚Äôs going to play my song
To carry me along

Like I said
You know I‚Äôm almost dead
You know I‚Äôm almost gone
And when the boatman comes
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

We all crossed when we were feeling lost
It‚Äôs just the tide
Katari cried the day her lover died
She recognized
Because he gave her
A life of real love
It‚Äôs no surprise
The nights are long
But the years are short
When you‚Äôre alive
Way back when would never be again
It was a time
It‚Äôs gonna catch you
So glad I met you
To walk the line

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know i'm almost gone
When the drummer drumms
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
When the boatman comes to ferry me away
To were we all belong

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
When the drummer drumms
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
When the boatman comes to ferry me away
To were we all belong

Let me live
So when it‚Äôs time to die
Even the reaper cries
Let me die
So when it‚Äôs time to live
Another son will rise

Yeah, yeah

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
When the drummer drumms
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
When the boatman comes to ferry me away
To were we all belong

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone

Like I said
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone

Bullet Proof

All around the world
I'd rather be in a band
Playin' my funky music as loud as I can

I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain
I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain

I don't want your war
I don't like the boom and bang
I don't want to song,I don't like the songs you sing


Bunker Hill

She
She
She

Off the bus, onto the train
Getting all to high, gotta head on 5th and main
I look like you, I feel the same
You don't even know my name

I got this town all to myself
Well everybody's gone to the everybody shelf

Are you coming through? Do you want me to take your body?
It would be so cool to be cool with you 
I said lordy lordy

I'd run like blood into the drain
Rainin' daily, medley stays up in my brain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you even want to stay?

Are you coming through? Do you want me to take your body?
It would be so cool to be cool with you 
I said lordy lordy
Where'd you get that bruise? Do you want me to take your body?
I must still, taking your bod away

Are you coming through? Do you want me to take your body?

Where'd you get that bruise? Do you want me to take your body?
I must still, taking your bod away


By The Way

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street, but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Black Jack, dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike, but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Oh, ah, guess you never meant it
Oh, ah, guess you never meant it
Oh, ah, guess you never meant it
Oh, ah, guess you never meant it
Oh, ah, guess you never meant it
Oh, ah, guess you never meant it
Oh, ah, guess you never meant it
Oh, ah

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for


C'mon Girl

Everything inside of me
Is burning up for you to see

And if we should get into it
A two way kind of syndicate, ho

Compare us to a ferris wheel
Just be sure of what you want to steal
Some people do it by the book
But I prefer to go by feel, tell me

I wanted to get outta here
But every time I reappear
And know I have the words my dear
To whisper right into your ear, hey, yeah

C‚Äômon girl
Let‚Äôs get it right
Let‚Äôs get it right
Let‚Äôs get it right

The spirit of a dragon‚Äôs tear
Is lovely at this time of year

The cave within your mountainside
Is deeper than it will be wide hold me

My disenchanted diplomat
Asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and
I want you to be sure of that, tell me

And if you let it germinate
I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news that it was you
Who tried to instigate, hey

Blessed are the hypocrites
Outwitted but she never quits
The trouble with a band of slits
Is washing off the muddy bits, hey, yeah

Oh yeah, she‚Äôs with me and I‚Äôm your man
If I can‚Äôt find you no one can

Californication

Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication

It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The Sun may rise in the East
At least it settles in the final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity Skin is this your chin
Or is that war your waging?

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the Boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population, everybody's been there and
I don't mean on vacation

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication

Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest
There is no test
But this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication


Can't Stop

Can't stop, addicted to the shin dig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend

Knocked out but boy you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation

This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute I'm passing out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
How about you

10 more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shin dig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend

Knocked out but boy you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Come from space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read through


Castles Made Of Sand

Down the street you can hear her
Scream
You're a disgrace as she slams the
Door
In his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and
Drool
He cries: oh girl you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you
And me had
Against the door he leans and start a
Scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden
Green

And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea
Eventually

A little indian brave who before he was
Ten
Played wargames in the woods with his
Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior indian chief
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle
But something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea
Eventually

There was a young girl
Whose heart was a frown
'Cause she was crippled for life
And she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed
She could stop livin'
So she decide to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of
The shore
And to her legs she smiled
You won't hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made
Her jump and say
Look a golden winged ship is passing my
Way

And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

And so castles made of sand
Slips into the sea
Eventually


Catch My Death

Death
Let me catch my breath
Let me see what's left
Let me see what's true
Do I really want to
Run from my depths
Will I have regrets
Will I ever find you
Will I ever find the words
That give me motive to express

Bread
Will I go unfed
Will I be that who rushed on in
To where angels fear to tread
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
When you're leaning on love
Those greateful dead

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Chess, let me play my best
When I do regress, let it all unwind
'Cause we're never confined
To the board unless
Less a second I guess
Look into the sky where we all comply
With something higher than the
Rest my love, sail through

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Someone like you

Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I'm a child
Stayed for a while

Flesh is it meaning less
But we all protest
To the lest request
Is there anything you
Could now suggest
Did I do my best
Did I leave it better
Even though we look to be
Just  mildly obsessed with you
Sail through

Someone like you
To be there


Catholic School Girls Rule

Catholic school girls rule...

In the class she's taking notes
Just how deep is my throat
Mother Mary don't you know
She's got eyes like Marylin Monroe

Catholic school girls rule...

From the cross she's raised her head
This is what the sister said
Give no love until you're wed
Live no life until you're dead

The good books says we must suppress
The good books says we must confess
But who cares what the good books says
Cause now she's taking off her dress

Catholic school girls rule...

Lead us into temptation
We are pure divine creation
Talkin' about my generation
Injected with the seed of emaculation
Catholic!


Cereal Song

Intro:

Well heroin, heroin
And cocaine, cocaine
I loved them both

But they took my life, they took my friends
They won't give 'em back, well I want 'em back
Give 'em back now

And what has it gotten me
Just some teeth I can't chew
My favorite cereal with

Being cool
And looking good
Keith Richards and Lenny Bruce
And all of them
Well I give up

Sometimes
I'll get sad
Or I'll get mad
About where I should be
And where I am
I wanna go back

But where has it gotten me
I'm 35 years old now
I wash dishes in a restaurant

Well my friend Robert
He can't stop
And his teeth are falling out
And he's living at his mom's
And it's no fun
No

I guess I'm lucky to be alive
Yeah I'm lucky I'm alive
'Cause I should be dead
Well I have been dead
But I'm not now
No

And what has it got me
Just some teeth I can't chew
My favorite cereal with

Where has it gotten me
I'm 35 years old now
Work in a fucking restaurant

Well heroin
Heroin
And cocaine
Cocaine
I loved them both

Coffee Shop

I am just a lousy burn
Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb the crumb
Something or someone to come
Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
Jooze the muse

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hotspot

Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room the groom

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hotspot


Crosstown Traffic

You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time, that a
Ninety mi-les an hour girl is the
Speed I drive

You tell me it's al-right
You don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to
Take you for a drive

You're just like

Get through to you

Run over you

Accused of hit and run
Tyre tracks all across your back I can (heh)

But ah, darlin' can't you see my
Signals turn from green to red
And with you I see a traffic jam
Straight up ahead

Dani California

Getting born in the State of Mississippi
Papa was a copper
And mama was a hippie
In Alabama
She would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew
That there was anything more than poor
What in the world
Does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana

She‚Äôs a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin‚Äô:
Baby, watcha gonna?
Looking down the barrel
Of a hot metal 45
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She‚Äôs my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
She‚Äôs a lover, baby, and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin‚Äô
When it got a little brighter

With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come
When I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded

I love my baby to death

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth

Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

Push the fader
Gifted animator
One for the now
And eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man
Was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands

Gone too fast

Dark Necessities

Coming on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play, so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?

Spinning knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light and a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say
Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design, and
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand
Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time?
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac, so I
Move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll
Everything must go away
Oh, what do you say?
Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design


Death Of A Martian

Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
Balleradio
Make room for clara's bare feet
The love of a martian

Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door

Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I

Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I lost today
And these are the things that I

Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This martain ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards bark at donkeys
The love of a martian

Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul

Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Look at love today
These are the best that I

Lots of love just keep it comin'
Making something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I lost today
And these are the things that I

She's got sword in case
Tho this is not her lord incase
The one who can't afford to face
Her image is restored to grace

Disappeared
No trace
Musky tears
Suitcase

The down turn brave
Little burncub bearcareless turnip snare
Rampages pitch color pages
Down and out but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages
No loft

Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude
For the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its
It's for you

Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck
Muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own mysteries
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny who's bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get you broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles away


Deck The Halls

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.


Deep Kick

It started when we were little kids.
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
given to us by our parents.
We got together and wrote on desks
and slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
and slipped through whatever cracks we could find,
minds altered, we didn't falter
in portraving hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe.
we loved the dirty city
and the journeys away from it.
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves,
chase tails round and round in downward spirals,
leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind.
Still, the brothersbloodcomradespartnerfamilycuzz was impenetrable
and we lived inside it
laughing with no clothes, and everything experimental 'till death was upon us.
In our face, mortality.
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us,
and did, while the giant grey monster grew
more poisoned and volatile around us,
jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around.
Nothing is the same.
So we keep moving.
We keep moving.

(Ooooooooooooh Shit! Ooooooooooooh Shit!)

Went off and got some hair cuts
Lookin wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a Bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
The mothersfuckers woke us up

Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs

Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no no

Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs

(Oooooooooooh Shit! Ooooooooooooh Shit!)

We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealin' anything that we could
Gotta sneak into the Starwood
Gotta peak into the deep good

I remember...
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
and we did some real bad stuff
but the Butthole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
Yeah we were young
And we were looking
looki-i-ing
looking for that deep kick...
Yeah seen 'em come, seen 'em go...

(And I feel I'm getting close to you)


Desecration Smile

All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all thru someone else
(Another girl bad for my health)

Celebrated but undisturbed
Serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen but its never heard
(Serenaded by the terror bird)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling black out of oblivion
And I'd like to think that I'm your number one
I'm
(Rolling black out of oblivion)

I wanna leave but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
I'm a (a broken record runnin' low on luck)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face

We could all go down to
Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice
She enjoys
We could all come up with
Something new to be destroyed
We could all go down

I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I'm
(Slow to finish but I am quick to start)

Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face


Detroit

Find me in the suburbs and
The shadow of decay
Rolling rings of rubber and
The band begins to play

Am I on the right side of the left side of your brain?
Can you see the rising of old yesterday's remains?

Funkadelic said it best, I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness

Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like

The Stooges and J Dilla, yeah
They tore this town apart
Put me back together, well
I guess that's quite an art

Henry won the war, you see
But not with pen or sword
He did it with the little thing I think it's called a Ford

Funkadelic said it best, I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness

Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like

Don't Forget Me

I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm
Make you want to re-assume
Now we know it all for sure

I'm a dance hall dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall
Up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you wanna go

I'm a meth lab first rehab
Take it all off
And step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way

I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of
Everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you wanna go

(Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend)
Don't forget me
I can't hide it
Come again make me excited

I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread
Inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure

I could show you
To the free field
Overcome and more
Will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you wanna go

(Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend)
Don't forget me
I can't hide it
Come again get me excited

(Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend)
Don't forget me I can't hide it
There's a match now let me light it

I'm the bloodstain
On your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure

Make the hair stand
Up on your arm
Teach you how to dance
Inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you wanna go

I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
Come again and tell me when you wanna go
(More will be revealed my friend)


Dosed

I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do?
Take it away
I never had it anyway
Take it away
And everything will be okay

In you a star is born and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
This is the way
I wanted it to be with you
This is the way
I knew that it would be with you
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do?
Take it away
I never had it anyway
Take it away
And everything will be okay

Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life


Dreams Of a Samurai

Standing naked in your kitchen
Feeling free that I could be alive
Clearly I'm a contradiction
Too young to be my wife

A peaceful storm is never hectic
Her mellow voice that I could be within
The uniform is anorexic
A jealous choice won't win

A metamorphosis samurai
You got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai

Paint your face cause I'm a black foot
I thought I counted up the fireflies
Close enough to get a good look
Time to mobilize

A metamorphosis samurai
You got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me, I've gone insane

Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies

The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me, I've gone insane

Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown

Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me, I've gone insane

See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane


Easily

Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today
Shao Lin shouted a rose
From his throat
Everything must go
A lickin' stick is thicker
When you break it to show
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for

Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cave
Shao Lin's shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of
All the thing that you own
Everything must go

I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over
But it's only on the rise
Calling calling
For something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for

Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back

Shao Lin's shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of
All the thing that you own
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for

Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy

Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back


Emit Remmus

The California animal is a bear
Angeleno but the devil may care
Summer time to talk to and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take to you the movies there
We could walk through Leicester Square
What could be wetter then
An English girl American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice is yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primirose Hill
What could be wetter then
An English girl American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It's all right
It's all right

Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
It's all right

The California flower is a poppy child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter then
An English girl American man

London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right


Encore

Listen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon, we got high
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space, too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut, Soviet Spy
Every now and then, when I remember to befriend the little things in life

Hey, you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

Later on I'll read to you the things that I've been needing to say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had, tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off 'fore you die
Take a little breath before you catch an early death, there is so much sky

Hey, you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

Skinny brains and little stains upon your face
Teenage remains, tell me more
Lifted in the fifties, when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now


Eskimo

In the name of it's for you I
Bought it all and it's all on true I
Know, I'm a little slow desperate and it shows
In the name of spindestry,a burning bush and it busted me
Who stole all the rain and snow
Who will be my eskimo that's what I wanna know
It's time to under go, somewhere in Mexico
I'll make a room for you
A simple point of view, someone to deep the two
Searching for an eskimo, searching and I wanna know 
Someone like you, desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an eskimo, someone like you.
In the name of Jesus Christ I 
Sold my soon and I named my prize I
Soo, just a little low
Who will be my eskimo, that's what I wanna know
Before I under go, somewhere in Mexico
I'll make a room for you, a simple point of view
Someone to deep the two
Searching for an eskimo
Searching and I wanna know someone like you
Desperate and I gotta go, searching for an eskimo
Someone like you.
In the name of Oscar Wilde I
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I
Go, toe-to-toe with a hoe, well to find an eskimo.


Especially In Michigan

Life is my friend
Rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
Well I could be your friend

White clouds I'm in
A mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
Well I‚Äôm in Michigan

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
(Especially in Michigan)

Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I‚Äôm slipping in
Into Michigan

The tainted new librarian
Who fainted when she tucked you in
Let's float away like zeppelins
(On stoic gusts of Northern wind)

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Life is my friend
Underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
When I'm in Michigan

Throw me in the looney bin
‚ÄòCause I can take it on the chin
The cleavage of your pillow skin
(Is moving like a violin)


Ethiopia

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
When you give your love away
You get a feeling for

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Live to love another day
Even when you feel unsure

More and more I wanna raise
Raise my bar
And raise your stakes

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
When I lay there wide awake
For my son I‚Äôll make

Tell my boy
I love him so
Tell him
So he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
We walk out in that road

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Somethin‚Äô good gonna come your way
Just look out your door

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Tell 'em what you want to say
No matter what you might incur

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Steal my heart to give away
Make me want to say

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
You and I are sewn the same
More and more and more
Each day


F.U.

Fuck You
Fuck your whole family and your beverages
Fuck You
Fuck your little sister and your little brother
Fuck You
Fuck all your friends and everyone
Fuck You
Fuck your little puppy and your puppy dog
Fuck You....


Factory Of Faith

All my life I was
Swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple
Never playing good defense
We were gunnin‚Äô for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there
So I couldn‚Äôt really get her

Factually I ‚Äì I‚Äôm just a piece of it
Factually I ‚Äì the very least of it

Piece of work
I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore
A busy mind could go berserk
Feast on this
I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip
When I opened up the book

Factually I ‚Äì I‚Äôm just a piece of it
Factually I ‚Äì the very least of it
Factually I ‚Äì it‚Äôs just the medicine
Makes you wanna cry ‚Äì why don't they let us in

Be my wife
I think you‚Äôre right that we should mate
Tell your friends
I‚Äôve got a factory of faith
Late last night
I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends
I‚Äôve got a factory of faith
I‚Äôve got a factory of

Crack your whip
She‚Äôs confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there
But not as much for round trip
All this time
I was searching for a dream
I was slippin‚Äô in and out
Of every other sex machine


Falling Into Grace

What ever never knew
That I could feel so good
Smile in your eyes
What ever never knew
That I could walk through wood
I guess I never tried
A million years old
But just a little girl
Vibin' off the gong
Rubbin' on the bowls
Make you float around
Make your lovin' strong

And when we get
In the same place
At the same time
It is your grace
That I want to
Fall right into now
To love avow

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk

She moves in a rapture
That her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning
Head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar

You can smell the purple light
Comin' from her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher
'Cause that's what you are
I wanna be your pet

And when we get
In the same place
At the same time
It is your grace
That I want to
Fall right into now
To love avow

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk

(chanting thing )

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk

Feasting On The Flowers

I was walking through the streets, I could not hear my best friend call
He was feeling incomplete, about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember, there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone, it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
The next dimension show me in

We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember, there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-six, a number much too small for someone's golden years

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone, it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bit my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
The next dimension show me in

You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said: Oh, don't look back, just look ahead

You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said: Oh, don't look back, just look ahead

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone, it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah


Feels So Good

Well everybodys got an opinion thats loud and unbending
I spend my time healing and mending, together
Its a question of whether live positive well i give
P-Nut joins our back, must be arthritic
Tim is from the '70's and so we live it
SA has the wisdom of a nobel laureate
I'm down for our days of glory
It's easy to do when you're up with Sexton
A rhythmatic genius, turnin' up the next one
Would you know, you're a bro, I flow in that circumstance
You'll get your chance

Becuase payback is a motherfuckin' mission
To the sharp-ass rocks slippin' on us but we rock
It comes to writing on us derision
Sendin you a voice now we're sending you a vision

And those who fought me they say they taught me everything Iknow
I go aww, when I hear that, that chit and that caht, bullshit!
So sick of me knowing everything, saying!

In your face
That's right
And it feels so good
In your face
Yeah
It feels so good

Take it to 'em bro, throw down, now say
Settin' forth a course I'm really wiggin' out
In my dome I roam, no time to doubt
Fucked up you right there while I was rhymin'
Now you're sulking in the corner, a baby crying
Hittin' up now we feelin' to rock Mars
Fuckin' up the shit, now their heads bob
We ain't new to jack swing, the groove and that
We got crazy factiffs and we all that
I don't often rock and I'm a laureate
I don't pull the punch you know I'm throwin' it
Freestyles my style on the mic and flex
You're stalkin' the mind of a punk that's next

I get retarted now that I started you know
A condition which I keep close together
Like the kind buds you know my scene
My team thinks I sing supreme, but you, the weasel,
Try to bring us down but in reality it make you look like aclown
Too bad cause we'll be sittin' in the sun and choose a rocky assfast ball

In your face
That's right
And it feels so good
Choose a lock y'all
In your face
Yeah
It feels so good

Yo P-Nut, beat that thing

Won't you warm the mic Nicholas
Can't get with this my stream of conscieceness is a sea
Much like Bukowski with a rage
Speakin' to page
Beasts in the cage
Jumpin' off the stage
Divin'
Thrivin'
Strivin' for a better day or say
(Strive for a better day SA?)
Beat back by flesh
Shatterd doors braggin' fists to the sky we're feelin' high
Has to live and die

Just take a moment to have a fit once in a while
You know, you know
I do it daily and like it but that's my style, yeah, here I go

In your face
And dow your throat
And it feels so good
'fraid so
Fuck it up y'all
In you face
And down your throat
It feels so good
That's all


Fela's Cock




Fight Like A Brave

All you slingers and friends
Hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard
I'm not here to box
This is no showdown
So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from Park Ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talkin' bout that freedom
Fight like a brave

Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission

Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme

Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

Tell me now girl 'cause I've got a feeling for you


Funny Face

It must have been your funny face
It must have been your laugh
It must have been your paper chase that
Wasn't quite enough

It must have been your tiny dance that
Made me laugh out loud
Must have been your angel dust that
Put me on your cloud

You're the reason why...
You're the reason I...

It must have been your love
It must have been your love... I said
It must have been your love... In a little bit...
It must have been your love

It must have been your puppy eyes
That made me step outside
It must have been the sigh of tears that
Let me know I cried

It must have been your bunny shake
It must have been your love
A lot of girls won't come around
They treat me like a wolf

It must have been your love
It must have been your love... I said
It must have been your love... I gotta get that
It must have been your love

You're my angel baby
You're my darling
You're my star
Lo lo lo lolita
Let her see me deep in love

You're the reason why...
You're the reason I...

It must have been your love
It must have been your love... now
It must have been your love...
It must have been your love

You're my angel baby
You're my darling
You're my star
Lo lo lo lolita
Let her see me deep in love

I've sighted eyes in a crooked frown
Make more of life, just settle down
Every single little princess needs a crown
Make more of life, just settle down

[Solo]

Give It Away

What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser?

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say hell yes

I'm a low brow, but I rock a little, know how?
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart, get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now

Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley, walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me, can't you see I'm gonna cough it?

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

Lucky me swimmin' in my ability
Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

My mom, I love her, 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice, young love, chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly, you'll be the wiser

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

Go Robot

I called the teacher 'cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow?
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from

I don't take these things so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore

Somebody hooted and they hollered: Can I buy a vowel?
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl?

I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

I wanna thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know, she looked like Alice Cooper

I don't think that it's so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

I wanna thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

I'm kissing high and low, our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret

I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

I wanna thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin


Gong Li

Some people say you hate me,
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through
Some people say you hate me,
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through,
Some people sad I pray for,
No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his
Some people sad I pray for,
The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give

Some people say you played me,
I don't care if it's true, I'm waiting here for you,
Some people say you made it,
I'm not afraid to know, when things are getting low
Some people say you hate me,
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through
Some people say you hate me,
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through


Good Time Boys

Indeed it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel round the world, gettin' naked on the stage
Bustin' people out of their everyday cage

We like to think
We make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud
Our mammy and our pappy

Funky young kings, we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talking about my buddy, funk it up Fishbone

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day, the good time boys that might jest be president

Like a pack of mad hatters
Who come from outer space
Our swinging's going to shatter
Every stone cold face

Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Making more that money, more than money can buy
I stop! And take a listen to the monsters try

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

If you don't believe me you can ask John Doe
Because his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you about the band called fire hose

To those of you who doubt
The nature of our spirit
We play it out loud
For everyone to hear it

Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah


Goodbye Angels

Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my girl

In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time

Overkill, you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light

Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, big fight

Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young

Say goodbye, my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, this life

Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, find you

Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo, wonder

Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, story

Say goodbye, my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Babe, I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick, it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my bat

Suicide is never gonna save you
When I cried, it was because I came to
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, kiss this


Goodbye Hooray

Junior pimp at the old caf√©
Got to chase those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound

Hustlers get what they deserve
But it‚Äôs always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

See you around I‚Äôll see you around
I‚Äôll play all night
Can‚Äôt get uptight
I‚Äôll lead all your mind games astray
See you around I‚Äôll see you around
I‚Äôll play all night
Can‚Äôt get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray!

Curb your tongue oh scallywag
Because you‚Äôve got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day


Grand Pappy Du Plenty

Green Heaven

About this planet there is something I know
There‚Äôs a very big difference between
Above and below
Friend foe or bro leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the
Soul of a crow

Here above land man has laid his plan
And yes it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution?
Not to mention hardcore chemical pollution
If you think a different way you‚Äôre in a mental institution
And that‚Äôs a heart felt shame
‚ÄòCause everyone is crazy, everyone‚Äôs the same
So why should only Larry, Curly
And Moe be to blame

Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace loving whales flow through
Liquid outer space
Groovin‚Äô and glidin‚Äô as graceful as lace
Never losing touch with the ocean‚Äôs embrace
Diviner than the dolphin that there is none
‚ÄòCause dolphins justa like to have a lot of fun
No one tells ‚Äòem how their life is run
And no one points at ‚Äòem with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin‚Äô in schools but everyone‚Äôs the teacher
Someday mister dolphin I know I‚Äôm going to meet you

Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you‚Äôre a Jew
Or beating black ass that‚Äôs nothing new
Trigger happy cops they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas but that‚Äôs not all
They got puke ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor if you‚Äôre rich you pay the bail
So support your police support your local wars
That‚Äôs the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? ‚ÄòCause the president‚Äôs a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck it‚Äôs the American tradition
Along with going fishin‚Äô apple pies in the kitchen
Isn‚Äôt it bitchin‚Äô seeing dead men in ditches


Guns of Brixton

When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun

When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting on death row

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell

You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of the harder they come

You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun

You can crush us
You can bruise us
Yes, even shoot us
But oh-the guns of Brixton

When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun

You can crush us
You can bruise us
Yes, even shoot us
But oh-the guns of Brixton

Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game is called survivin'
As in heaven as in hell

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton


Hanalei

Feeling good and I don't know why
Another day and another high
I walk around like I am on the ray, hey yeah
Somewhere way out in the rays of Hanalei

I met a girl and I liked her vibe
Another day and another ride
I met a girl who wants to save the world
Make it safe
For someone else to find their faith

I'm away
Hanalei
I'm away

A simple song and it made me cry
I really don't want to pass me by
A simple song that spoke of Hemingway, hey
The revolution in your blood
Creates the wave

I picked her up on the road to surf
Looked a lot like a mother Earth
She said hello my name
Is Charlotte Gray, hey
Make it safe
For someone else to find their fate

I'm away
Hanalei
I'm away


Happiness Loves Company

Start marchin'
'Cause you think you shot to #1
Counting days and
Skipping your stones into the sun
Over age and under thumb
Does it weigh a ton
I'll be yours tonight
Living the dream of a meteorite

Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of LA

Short stroking doesn't fly
Better to go for broke
Watchu smoking Mary Jane
And does it make you choke
Jumping the fence, riding the rails
Can you take a joke
I'll be yours today
Living the dream with a capital K

Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of LA

Tell me now, I'll tell you how
Just show me where to send

Make time for love and your happiness
The mothers of invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess, I guess

Half blinded
I'm reminded how to find the stairs
Nickel and dimin'
Think it's time
To play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry
What a quandary
Ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more
Better than ever like never before

Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of LA

Sweet talkin'
As I'm walkin' thru your part of town
Never again
Will Johnny C a Love Supreme be found
Is it ever meant to be
And is it so profound
Is it you and me
A billion to one make history


Hard To Concentrate

Hustle, bustle, and, so much muscle
Cells about to separate
Now I find it hard to concentrate
And, temporary this
Cash and carry 'em
Stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate

And, all I want is for you to be happy
And, take this moment to make you my family
And, finally you have found something perfect
And, finally you have found

Death defying this
Mess I'm buying its
Raining down with love and hate
Now, I find it hard to motivate

And, estuary is, blessed but scary
Heart's about to palpitate
Now, I'm not about to hesitate
And, want to treasure the rest of your days here
And, give you pleasure in so many ways dear

And, finally you have found something perfect
And, finally you have found
(Here we go)

Do you want me to show up for duty?
And, serve this woman, and honor her beauty

And, finally you have found something perfect
And, finally you have found

Yourself, with me, will
You, agree to take this man
Into your world
And now, we are as one

My lone ranger
The, heat-exchanger
Is, living in this figure eight
Now I do my best to recreate
And, sweet precision
And, soft collision
Heart's about to palpitate
Now I find it hard to separate

And, all I want is for you to be happy
And, take this woman and make you my family
And, finally you have found someone perfect
And, finally you have found

All I want is for you to be happy
And, take this woman and make you my family
And, finally you have found someone perfect
And, finally you have found

Yourself


Havana Affair

PT-boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a living, man
Pickin' the banana.
Now I'm a guide for the CIA
Hooray for the USA!

Baby, baby, make me a loco
Baby, baby, make me a mambo.

Went to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop - Havana au go-go
I used to make a living, man
Pickin' the banana
Hooray for Havana!

Baby, baby, make me a loco
Baby, baby, make me a mambo.


Heard It On The X

Do you remember back in nineteen sixty-six?
Country Jesus, hillbilly blues, that's where I learned my licks.
Oh, from coast to coast and line to line in every county there,
I'm talkin' 'bout that outlaw X is cuttin' through the air.

Anywhere, y'all, everywhere, y'all
I heard it, I heard it, I heard it on the X.

We can all thank Doctor B who stepped across the line.
With lots of watts he took control, the first one of its kind.
So listen to your radio most each and every night
'Cause if you don't I'm sure you won't get to feeling right.

Anywhere, y'all, everywhere, y'all,
I heard it, I heard it, I heard it on the X.

Anywhere, y'all, everywhere, y'all,
I heard it, I heard it, I heard it on the X.


Hey

Won't somebody come along
And teach me how to keep it alive
To survive

Come along and show me something
That I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet

I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it, when I know

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today

I don‚Äôt want to have to but I will
If that‚Äôs what I am supposed to do
We don‚Äôt wanna set up for the kill
But that‚Äôs what I am about to do

Later on I‚Äôll cut you off
When you‚Äôre screaming into the phone
Hard to own

Anyway I want to let you know
That everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me

You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you‚Äôre quick to get into your regret
Take a fall and now you got to give it all away

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today

I don‚Äôt want to have to but I will
If that‚Äôs what I am supposed to do
We don‚Äôt wanna set up for the kill
But that‚Äôs what I am about to do

I don‚Äôt want to have to but I will
If that‚Äôs what I am supposed to do
We don‚Äôt wanna set up for the kill
But that‚Äôs what I am about to do

Hey, what would you say if I stay
Stay for a while if I may
Say it again and I‚Äôll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I change
Change everything but my name
Play it again and I‚Äôll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time

You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret
But now I walk alone and talk about it, when I know

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today.

Hollywood

Take me back
Hold my hand
All the way back
To the brotherland
Take me back
I want to go back

Take me back
And my funky ass band
All the way back
To the broherland
Take me back

I want to go
As fast as I can
Slidin' on back
To the brotherland
Now children

With my funky ass jams
All the way back

As fast as I can
Slidin' on back
To the brotherland
Now children


Hometown Gypsy

Drivin‚Äô up the coast
To find a version of the truth
Left the backdoor swinging

Like a dirty little sleuth

The truth is I have never
Felt half this alive
Now it‚Äôs time to dance
Upon the grave called 45

Jacked up on some Kerouac
And surely bullet proof
The girl who taught me what to do
Was missing her front tooth

Gentle as a storm
Inside your mental health
I wanna find the answer
But I just can‚Äôt find myself

I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let‚Äôs run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown

Later I would look for love
Inside a woman‚Äôs dorm
A couch to keep me humble
And her breath to keep me warm

Ophelia was the girl
That I was feeling for
Come to realize
It was me who was the whore

A captain lost himself
Inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge
And we always wanted more

Drunken sailors
Seeking their geronimo
Instead they found the things
That they really didn‚Äôt wanna know

I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let‚Äôs run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown

Country roads
Would never let me stay
The way I played
Inside of yesterday

A devil‚Äôs growl and cat‚Äôs meow
Were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites
Were eating all the fun

A juggernaut of comedy
And blasphemy
I wanna stop the madness
But I think it has to be

I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let‚Äôs run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown

(Added to final song)
Country roads
Would never let me stay
The way I played
Inside of yesterday

Hey let‚Äôs run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown


How Deep Is Your Love

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
and the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again.

And you come to me on a summer breeze
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
and it's me you need to show
how deep is your love

(Chorus)
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
breaking us down when they all should let us be
we belong to you and me.

I believe in you
you know the door to my very soul.
you're the light in my deepest darkest hour
you're my saviour when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
when you know down inside that I really do
and it's me you need to show How deep is your love?

(Chorus)

La da da da da, la da da da da da da da da da da

And you come to me on a summer breeze
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
and it's me you need to show
how deep is your love

(Chorus)


How It Ends

Love is all the world
You say the world is gone
Love is all the world
You say it‚Äôs gone
I don‚Äôt

The party in your eyes
Says someone to caress
A party in the sky
I think I‚Äôll wear a dress

God saves us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh till we fall so why can‚Äôt we be friends

Mother taught me what to do
In cocktail times
Work and play all day
Until the sun is high

Haley and the comets
Sang an old rock jam
The ukulele play
Another song I'll brag

God saves us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh till we fall so why can‚Äôt we be friends

Stole a lot from Peter
Cause had to pay your Paul
And when you find that‚Äôs not enough
He‚Äôll break your fall

Some get on and some
Get off the carousel
I think it‚Äôs time to go
So I will fare thee well

God saves us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh till we fall so why can‚Äôt we be friends

Stole a lot from Peter
Cause had to pay your Paul
And when you find that‚Äôs not enough
He‚Äôll break your fall


How Strong

(Chorus)
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

I'll walk a water mile
Rest a while to kiss your smile
Laugh and roll and after a while
I'll begin to like your style

How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time

How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

Come on over show me your
Your glow soul I do adore
I'll be sure to drop my guard
Give it up it's not that hard

How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time

How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

Tested life but that's alright
Darker than the darkest night
Living hell and pollocks at you
Getting new down your back

How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?


Hump De Bump

40 detectives a week
40 detectives strong
Takin‚Äô a stroll down Love Street
Strollin‚Äô is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependant

Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu

Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bomp doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

Bump bump

Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It‚Äôs not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out

When I was an all aloner
Nothin‚Äô but a two-beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I‚Äôm wide awake now

Workin‚Äô the beat as we speak
Working the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin‚Äô, is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependent

Listen to me what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance
A chance to make out

Livin‚Äô in a citadel
It‚Äôs hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now


I'll Be Your Domino

Bang on my window if
You want to get your look out
I felt the wind blow when
She took her little book out

I'm steady loving on the 
Lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will
So ?

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glassess and fight

Under the heliomoon i'm
Going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you
Is looking like a sculpture

This recreation is amusing
And confusing
You never knew that it
Could feel so good while losing

(What you lose, your virginity)

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glassess and fight

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

My intuition was a 
Poppin' and a shakin'
The very thought of it was
All too much to take in

Curl up with lover we 
Could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above i'll 
Take the time to thank it

Down on the river tonight
Take off your panties and fight

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

I want to bury my face
Deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa but
They call her Desmadona

Come out and see me for
Some street comunication
I think it's sweet of you
To be my motivation

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow


I've Been Down

I've Been Down


I tumble into space, try to stop the fall
My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space

Could have floated 

I stumble 'round my home
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love fromno one
Could have floated My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've beendown 
My friends are aliens and I've been down 
Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back tolife 
I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces 
Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down 
I am the big rock star yeah I've been down 
I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out 
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own 
My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down 
My friends are aliens and I've been down 
I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil sneaks in anddeals and I've been down


I Could Die For You

Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't wanna live somebody else's life
This is what I wanna be
And this is what I give to you, because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time

I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose

I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really wanna do is turn into the motion beauty that I can abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it on and then
I'd find a way to share
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

Come again and tell me where you wanna go
What it means to me to be with you alone?
Close the door and no one has to know how we are
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

Make me wanna say

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose


I Could Have Lied

There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I don't care, you see, so what if I bleed?

I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

A mountain never seems to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true

I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now


I Feel Love

Ooh
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free
Ooh
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me
Ooh
I feel love, i feel love
I feel love, i feel love
I feel love

I feel love, i feel love, i feel love

Ooh


I Found Out

I've told you before, stay away from my door 
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
The freaks on the phone, don't leave me alone 
don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 


I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Now that I showed you what I've been through 
Don't take nobody's word what you can do 
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
Now that I found out I know I can cry 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man 
I heard somethin' 'bout my Ma' and my Pa '
They didn't want me so they made me a star 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Oh, Hare Krishna ain'tgot nothing on you 
Just keep you crazy with nothin' to do 
Keepin' you occupied with your pie in the sky 
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all 
I've seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
Don't let them fool you with them dope and cocaine 
No one can harm you, or feel your own pain 

I, I found out! 
I, I found this out!

I know where I'm goin'

And I got one for you
The trains leavin' just after dark
There's always room for a lovin' heart
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you wanna come too

I know my destination
It's all waiting for you
I got no hesitation
That's where I want to be
And by the time that the sun comes up
I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup
I know where I'm goin'
Don't you want to come too

Don't you wanna come
Don't you wanna ride
Don't you wanna be there by my side
Hand in hand
Holding on to
The sweet salvation
That's waiting for me and you

I know why I'm singin'
Don't you want to sing too
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'
Let the spirit move you

Just close your eyes
And let it flow
Lean your head back, let it go

I Like Dirt

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream
Live in a dream

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream
In your spring
Live in a dream

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one


I Wanna Be Your Dog

So messed up I want you here
In my room I want you here
Now we're gonna be face-to-face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place

And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well c'mon

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sands

And now I wanna be your dog
And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well c'mon


If You Have To Ask

A wanna be gangster, thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank, he's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head, Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Lock him in the eye, he's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be confusion proof
Pudding's sweet but too aloof
Orange eye girl with backslide Dew said
Yo homie, who you talkin' to?
A backed up paddywagon mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut to the cold upper middle class
Born to storm on boredom's face
And a little lust to the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race just loose their grace
The blackest hole in all of space
Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some

If you have to ask, you'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
If you have to ask, you'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go (oh woh woh)

Don't ask me why I'm flying so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly in my third eye
Searching for a soul bride, she's my freakette
Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret
Much more than meets the eye
To the funk I fall into my new ride
My hand, my hand
Magic on the one is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face like a stage on Vaudeville
I feel so good, can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum, rockin' my red hood

If you have to ask, you'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
If you have to ask, you'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go (oh woh woh)


If You Want Me To Stay

If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there
Then you'll know
For me to stay here
I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Cause I promise
I'll be gone for a while
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman
Taking up my time
Oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that
You're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one

I'll be good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good
I wish I could


If

And if I had a clue I'd know exactly what to do
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two

We could take a walk into the canyons of 5th avenue
Sing and dance, just to name a few
All I do, all I do

And if I heard the angels sing
I'd sing it back to you and bring sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown one that was a perfect fit for you

We could take a walk into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay a secret little hideway
Spend a little time inside of you

All I do, all I do
All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on you
All I do, all I do, all I do, all i do


In Love Dying

In love dying
There‚Äôs a flawless rain
In love dying
One foot in the astral plane
Someone‚Äôs sighing
There‚Äôs a virgin road
Waiting to be strode
Rope‚Äôs untying
This power I could not withhold

Satisfying
What do we contain
Can‚Äôt stop crying
These tears of change
Remain the same

My girl she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead

In love dying
Does it go two ways
In love dying
This body I can not detain

Wake up flying
She the solar shores
Passers buying
The memories we readorn

In love dying
Nothing to obtain
In love dying
No crawling thru
The halls of fame

In love dying
Loss becomes the gain
In love dying
Recreate me
So I may sustain


Joe

Burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch
Burn it up, no need to reconcile
Come and see me, i'm your west end perfect stranger, in america
Lady on that state's so full of style

Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe

The many boots that you have laced could tell a story, comin night and day (?)
No one said that you would need a crowd
The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
And now i only see your face in clouds

Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe
Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe

Tell me so (?)
Do you know
Does it show
When i'm low

And then again, when i feel your love from far away, i think of yesterday
I see a family we know how to smile
There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along
There comes a time when we will walk that mile

Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe
Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe


Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky

I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God damn what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

Puts us in a pumpkin shell where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie
No place for me
I bleed

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I decide to defy
Kill my trust if you must
But in my blood there is lust
For life
That's right
Apache blood is in my heart thrashing through me like a shark
Crashing through the dark

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I confide, confide
What am I supposed to do
I feel like I'm cut into confused
By rules
Do these two cultures clash or am I living in the past
I ask please tell me fast

Won't somebody testify kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye kick a hole right in the sky
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, that's right
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
I took my foot kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead fathers help me decide
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of and I've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man


Jungle Man

Deep inside the soul hole
Of Mother Earth
Father Time came
With a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes
Racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy
But I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone
Came thelonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire
From way down down down under

I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

Erupting from the ground
In hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano
I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein
Atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds
They make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man
It's time to take take take
Take the throne

I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can


Kill for your country

All over Shangai market
Put up the‚Ä¶
Holding wood‚Ä¶
All the way...

No one is quite so different
People who‚Ä¶
Understood‚Ä¶
Enemy√Ç‚Ä¶

The King and Queen are sleeping
Industry‚Ä¶
Ecstasy‚Ä¶.
Sympathy‚Ä¶

Sympathy‚Ä¶.

I walk the road today
Across the valley and I won't stay
I will miss this
Land and this promise

I'm streaming next to you
I won't believe it, Is it really true??!!
When they say you should
Kill for your country
Kill for your country

I've got three kids to feed
Fine woman and a need to speak
Far away from this
Land and its promise

I want to walk to you
I need a peace that I wish I knew
Time to leave and go
Kill for my country
Aaahh‚Ä¶ Kill for my country

Hold me down now, hold your fire
Not now folk that we inspire
Turn around and hold your fire

Shake 'em all off, make-belief
Control the line, just let me be
We're all just make-believe

Hold a child, met the man
Bring 'em all on to the grave
Barbershop and a close shave

Seen the goons, now, seen my chances
Running, from our enemy still
We are soldiers, we ain't dying yet!!...

Run 'em down, run √Ç'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire

This is my message to you
This is a tale of the tomb

Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire

Why can't we make it alone
Shake off the smooch on the phooooooone.


Knock Me Down (Original Long Version)

Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much too soon
Too much for me too much for you
You're gonna loose in time

Every turn looking to burn
Some never learn live and learn
Stop your searching for a curse
Before you end up in a hearse

Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside inside
Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie - your lie

Don't slip away and don't forget
I'll give you more than you can get
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
Come to me

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away?

Too late to tell you how I feel
I want you back but I get real
Can you hear my falling tears
Making rain where you lay

Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely


Knock Me Down

Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely


Lately

On the corner
Into my car
I drive forever
And never get far

The 45 is slowly getting loaded
Send another song to my star

California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up
Get it off
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Get it off
Take more than your

Woah woah
Woah woah

A pendulum inside of my head
Swinging low I hope to get hit
The overflow is slowly adding up
Another drop will never fix it

California mountains in the morning
Get along
Get it off
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Get it off
Take more than your
Faith

If I called you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I called you lately
I could be your man

Woah woah
Woah woah

Shut it down
Now look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead
A covered in flies

The big sleep
Without A bed of roses
A light of day
Will never tell lies

Fall along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Take more than your faith

If I called you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I called you lately
I could be your man

On the river
Into my dock
I paddle through
The shadow and fog

To ponder all of those
That came before me
Another piece for
Building my arch


Let's Make Evil

Let's make evil
Let's make good
I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirt word
Go down on you

Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me

CHORUS:
The water's falling clear
Interiors decieve i fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away

Let's get soft
Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red

Let's make peace
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head

Chorus

I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame

Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love

Some seem dirty
Some say clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange

Chorus

Slay my shame
Slay my shame
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame


Little Miss Lover

Little miss lover, 
Where have you been in this world for so long 
Well, I love a lover that feels like you 
Would you like to tag along? 

Well I really don't need any help little girl 
But I think you could help me out anyway 

Would you believe babe I've been looking for a sole 
That feels like you 
For some time 
Excuse me while I see 
If the gypsy in me is right 
If you don't mind 

Well he signals me ok 
So i think it's safe to say 
I'm gonna make a play 
Oh yeah 

See me walk towards you baby 
Ah give me some 
Oh get into it 

Hey, hey little miss lover 
Well now, there's so much you and me can discover 
And i think we should start, hey, we should start right now, baby


Love Of Your Life

Sat on a cliff
Wondering what did I miss
I watch the waves come in
Roll in, roll out
Without a single doubt

Love on a bluff
Is there ever enough
I stare into the air
Somewhere out there
The family affair
Bring home the night

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

She gave me the love

Coming up short
And I‚Äôm sad to report
We fuss and fight tonight
Your case, my case
Another day to waste

Lovers don‚Äôt mix
When they can‚Äôt even fix
A plot that has a twist
To share, my prayer
I need my baby bear
Come home tonight

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Hey, I know that I waited so long
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Oh, she gave me the love of my life
Tell her Flea, go ahead

Love Trilogy

My love comes
And when it does
It's a crazy kind of
Selective affection
My love flows like a wise guy's tie
in the zaniest of directions
My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be bigger than
The hoover dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fueled by
The love for my man
I love his mother and
The silly mystic man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad

My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues

My love is the zulu groove
My love is keep it or move
My love is a laughin' boozed
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is gettin' my food
My love, my love

My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a butter knuckle hands
My love for the swedes in the band
My love for the legs that I spin
My love for the fat mingy
My love, my love

My love is my gross inner self
My love is my dick in my head
My love is my gross inner self
My love is my dick in my head


Lovin' And Touchin'

Loving and touching and
Laughing and Squeezing and
Walking and Joking and
Smiling and Teasing

Loving and kissing and
Rubbing and scrubbing and
Styling and slumming and
Rolling and cumming

I'll hold you a lifetime
I'll love you forever
I'll make you my wife and
I'll never forget you

I'll give you my smile
On the face of your child
I will give you my love
I will give you my love

Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Love


Magic Johnson

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact
A claim that remains intact

M-A-G-I-C, see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C, magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams, but he doesn't give a fuck

Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck

Scott stops, pops and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named A.C. Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen

Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact
A claim that remains intact

M-A-G-I-C, see you in purple and gold
You can swim, but you won't get far, so you might as well go home
M-A-G-I-C, in buck we trust
Restoring order to the court and justice is a must

Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
Because they've got more moves than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum that deafens my ears

The one and only know
Of his kind sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
All time great super super star
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble

Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact
A claim that remains intact


Magpies On Fire

Magpgies on fire
Making love like little
Worms out on the porch can
Leave the medicine
Oh well I'm game
For anything at all

Scarecrows a liar
Spends the year alone
No one checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon
And now it's time to fall

All in all it's like the
Bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
Love

What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

All in all it's just
A call of something wise beyond your room
There's a changing of a major chord
Your minor threat will do, love

My gun misfired
Shot myself instead I guess
I always knew I'd be the one to lose
Last scream don't slane
Time to make a move

What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

All in all it's like the
Bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
Love
A bird who's going to live at half your age, girl
A bird who's never really here to say

What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

Least of all she's like
A bird who's now been
Freed from someone's cage


Make You Feel Better

She's the one she's the only one
She¬¥s got ripped back light
Gonna make me come
I say... when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

I say now I¬¥ll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we¬¥ll make it
Cause that¬¥s what we do.

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me
And that is why I

Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire
Jump up to meet.

I say now I¬¥ll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we¬¥ll make it
Cause that¬¥s what we do.

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
(Oh Yeah!)

In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck.

I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth
And a pack of style

I say... she¬¥s the one, she is the only one
Makes me search myself
Until I¬¥m done... and

Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars
Make a diagram... and

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better

Oh, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
for the red on rust... I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said

I say now I¬¥ll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we¬¥ll make it
Cause that¬¥s what we do.

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better

We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
Now...


Me And My Friends

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

Like two sweet peas
In an even sweeter pod
That's my friend
And my friends's named Bob
Like the devil knows hell
I know Bobby well
Well enough to tell you
'bout his 67 smells
Well enough to tell you
He's a hell-a-swell-a fella
Well enough to tell you
That we know each other better
Than we know our selves
Like freaks of a feather
We rock together
I know Bob well
But I think he knows me better

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

He's as close to me
As a friend can be
I'll be standin' by my buddy
He'll be standin' by me
Just another half of
The two headed freak
But I need him like
My heart needs to beat
At this point
In this friendly verse
I've gotta sing a little something
That I haven't rehearsed
It's about my man
And his name is Hillel
For whom my love
is soul-brother sacred
Take it Hickleberry
Slim boy take it

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

Jacky's eyes are closed
But he's right on course
Because he's guided by
The invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler
Bad as anybody's Porsche
He's a working class drummer
He's as strong as a horse

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends


Meet Me At The Corner

Please don‚Äôt ask me who
Who you think I am
I could live without that
I‚Äôm just a modest man

Meet me at the corner
And tell me what to do
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm messed up on you
And had I known
All that I do now
I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre thru now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around in wait
And I‚Äôll wait for you

Please don‚Äôt ask me where
Where you think I‚Äôve been
I‚Äôve been a lot of places
But this could be my win

I feel so bad
I thought you‚Äôd wanna know
Something I want to show
I thought you ought to know

Please don‚Äôt say you want
To keep in touch out there
To see you on the corner
Well that I just can‚Äôt bear

Hey and I turn
I turn my head when I thought
I saw a sign
From the gods
A sign from the gods
That you weren‚Äôt meant to be mine
And it‚Äôs fine

Takin‚Äô it all for a ride
Until the day when it‚Äôs gone
Mystified by where
It all went wrong
When it‚Äôs gone

I live and I learn
And I lose and I win
But it‚Äôs better than ever
Whenever I‚Äôm in
I thank you girl
For everywhere that we‚Äôve been


Melancholy Mechanics

Persistant mystic faults my vision
It's like always this point of collision
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
3 pounds of grain
About to burst
Inside my 3 pound universe
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short
You know they just don't get that low
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation
Cleaner than light
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers
Of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,
Alone in the constellation of alienation
Detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait for the wave to break


Mellowship Slinky In B-Major

I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "Yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I cannot keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella

I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things

Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, Purple Haze now
Good God, the baddest of brains now
Good God, any day now
Good God, ridin' my sleigh now

Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Goodman Truman Capote
Talking about my thoughts 'cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on my porch 'cause I lost my house key
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo

Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, De Niro's insane now
Good God, rackin' my brain now
Good God, any day now
Good God, take me away now, take me away

Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brothers bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a Whole Lotta Love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few


Menina Mulher da Pele Preta

Essa menina mulher da pele preta
Dos olhos azuis e sorriso branco
N√£o est√° me deixando dormir sossegado
Ser√° que ela n√£o sabe que eu fico acordado

Pensando nela, todo dia, toda hora
Passando pela minha janela, todo, dia toda hora
Sabendo que eu fico a olhar, com mal√≠cia
A sua pele preta, com mal√≠cia
Seus olhos azuis, com mal√≠cia
Seu sorriso branco, com mal√≠cia
Seu corpo todo, enfim, com mal√≠cia (com mal√≠cia)

Ser√° que quando, eu fico acordado
Pensando nela, ela pensa um pouco em mim?
Um pouco em mim, com malicia

Com mal√≠cia


Mercy Mercy

Mercy mercy mercy me
Look around
I need another remedy
The art of noise philosophy
Better yet
I'll let you get ahead of me

Mercy Mercy Mercy me
Come around
I need another enemy
Anyone could clearly see
The summer breeze
is part of my anatomy

When it's written in britain
We get a littlw smitten
Like a kitten
The cuddle is where I'm benetfittin'

Any higher the buyer
Would have to pacifier
Up on the wire the flyer
Is gonna satisfy her

My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Comin' down
I've got a case of gravity
Even though we disagree
Give a kiss
'Cause life could be the death of me

Acrobatic the static
Is getting to dramatic
Comin' down with the system
We're getting' systematic

Facilitating the mating
My love is circulating
Rejuvenating the fading
But never dilating

My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Mercy mercy mercy me
Lovin' on the color of an Emily
Easy as a guarantee
Better yet I'll show you
What you want to see

My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Re-enter forever
I want you to feel this
My gentle defender
Step forward and steal this


Midnight

Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one

Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they`re cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well, we go

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story

The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpio's at nine
Like the fear that's in eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know

Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well, we go

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Into the shadow show and

Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the loaded kids
All better take note of this
For the story

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story


Million Miles of Water

Broke down, I found
Even when you think you need a rest
You will live to fight another round
I know its too bad, so sad
All the things that we could've been and could've had

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water

You were my muse
Just because you happen to have a bomb doesn't mean you light the fuse
I know that my girl, big lie
Four years in and you never even said goodbye

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water dear

Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without
Now I found it right here
I want you to remember dear

We were two of a funny kind
So damn blind but now we got to nevermind
I know that this is the end, we tried
So hard, but now I got to lose a friend

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water dear

Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without
Now I found it right here
I want you to remember dear


Millionaires Against Hunger

We're millionaires against hunger

I'm a millionaire and i got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as i'm concerned, why that's okay

Well i'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as i'm concerned, i got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, i've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, i've got to say
You and i, we're millionaires
But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts
And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize
There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide
We've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives

We're millionaires against hunger

Hey hey mr. millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
A spiritual price do you care?
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare

I'm a millionaire and i got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as i'm concerned, why that's okay

Well i'm a millionaire too all i know that is true
Is that i've got more cash than i can use
I want anything that i can have
But i don't need nothin' and i never have
Each damn day my heart's set far
But i'll be okay, 'cause i don't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion
So damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare
At the city at night, you know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires
Every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and i will now concern
To the type of problem that helps us learn

We're millionaires against hunger

Hey hey mr. millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare


Mini Epic (Kill For Your Country)

All over shanghai market
Put up the, holding wood
All the way

No one is quite so different
People who, understood
Enemy

The king and queen were sleeping
Industry, ecstasy
Sympathy

Sympathy

I walk the road today
Across the valley and I won't stay
I will miss this
Land and this promise

I'm streaming next to you
I won't believe it, is it really true?
When they say you should
Kill for your country
Kill for your country

I've got three kids to feed
Fine woman and a need to speak
Far away from this
Land and its promise

I want to talk to you
I need a peace that I wish I knew
Time to leave and go
Kill for my country
Aah...kill for your country

Hold me down now, hold your fire
Not now folk that we inspire
Turn around and hold your fire

Shake 'em all off, make-belief
Control the line, just let me be
We're all just make-believe

Hold a child, meet the man
Bring 'em all on to the grave
Barbershop and a close shave

Seen the goons, now, seen my chances
Running, from our enemy still
We are soldiers, we ain't dying yet

Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
This is my message to you
This is a tale of the tomb

Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Why can't we make it alone
Shake off the smooch on the phone


Minor Thing

I Change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing
He knows everything
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
He knows everything

You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasin'
Cat fight, intimidation

To read a mind you've got to
Redefine the line to make your circle sing
He knows everything
You make a sound
The spell is bound to come around
It's just a minor thing

He knows everything
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
He knows everything

You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasin'
Cat fight, intimidation
All out interfacing
Black star motivation
Vampire sugar junkie
Data basin' infiltration


Mommasan

51-50 Bulletproof glass
Take away vinny play
Attempted to the past
So you shed tears that felt
The eyes the blood and the hammerhead
Something you buy and just can‚Äôt penetrate
A loss of nature that do state
Rearrange the change and recreate
A wake up song come on and levitate

Oh momma please don‚Äôt cry
I promise I won‚Äôt die
And if I stay too long
Well I will be forever in your favour
Forever always yours
Forever always

Momma please mommasan

Two persons on the days I‚Äôll be the numb one
Passion flower family
Cause I‚Äôm the one, the one and only blood son
So hard to understand

Do you believe in one steer-in
I‚Äôll be there; just because I can

Oh momma please don‚Äôt cry

And if I stay too long
Well I will be forever in your favour
Forever always yours
Forever always
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come baby said

Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said

Monarchy Of Roses

The crimson tide is flowing thru
Your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime
Are promises we keep

Do you like it rough I ask
And are you up to task
The calicos of Pettibon
Where cultures come to clash

Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
Mary wants to build it up
And Sherri wants to tear it all back down girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses

The cross between my former queen
Her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland
A lovely cross to bare

Several of my best friends know
The secrets of this town
Mary wants to raise it up
And Sherri wants to spin it all around girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

Hey
We all want the rose you know
Hey
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to
The story knows that I will never taunt you
Hey
We all want the rose you know
Hey
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to
The story knows that I will always haunt you


My Boy, My Girl

My boys, they like to tell me when I'm wrong [hey now]
My girl, she like to sing now sing my song
Everybody tell me when I'm wrong [today]
Anyway, I say
My boys (hey), they like to tell me when I'm bad [c'mon]
Make me happy when I'm sad [c'mon now]
Take it Johnny!

I said my girl, she like to say "that's what I had"
When I'm here, now when I'm wrong, and when I'm bad
Anyway, I'd like to say "oh yeah"
C'mon Chad!

My boy, he like to tell me what I had
Yeah now, what dyou do with everything you've had?
I don't know, that ain't bad
Woo, no, that ain't bad


My Friends

My friends are so depressed
I feel the question of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

X Girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate on the prison phone
They want to give her 7 years
For being sad

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on the brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

Imagine me
Taught by tragedy
Release is peace

I heard a little girl
And what she said was something beautiful
To give your love no matter what
Is what she said

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself


My Lovely Man

I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancin' like a fool
Shuffle step you funky mother
Come to me all warm as covers

Rest with me my lovely brother
For you see there is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon, save me a seat

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

In my room I'm all alone
Waiting for you to get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Just in case you never knew
I miss you slim, I love you too
See my heart, It's black and blue
When I die I will find you

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Well I'm cryin'
My lovely man
Well I'm cryin'
My lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man
We have some good time
My lovely man


Myself

Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still havent had my fulfill

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?

Broken heart and broken bones
Think of how a castrated horsefeels
One more quirky cliche'd phrase
You're the one i wanna refill

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?

Most people don't realize
That two large pieces of coral,
Painted brown, and attached tohis skull
With common wood screws can makea child look like a deer

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?

Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still havent had my fulfill

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?


Naked In The Rain

Standin' on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight

Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughing at the blues

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness

Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just wanna play

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it


Never Gone Away

you've never gone away from my head
you've never gone away from my heart
(i tried to hide from you
i tried to keep myself alone)all the letters i sent you
you'll read again tonighti even thought i was wrong
cause you didn't receive with love
those letters i wrote to you
when i still love you


Never Is a Long Time

If I stall at all or
Hesitate
The world of always
Never seems to wait
A comedy that could be
So divine
Never is a long time

A shadow born
To steal the light of day
You woke me up
And said, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let‚Äôs play‚Äù
Well now I know
This never has it‚Äôs way

You are, you are
The star I say
From far from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all to stay
By you, by you
By you, by you
For you I do

I thought I‚Äôd done it all
I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked
As good as you
Now every never
That I knew was fine
Never is a long time

And now I share
This feeling with my dad
Stolen goods are not always
Half that bad
The never that we‚Äôll always

You are, you are
The star I say
From far from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all to stay
By you, by you
By you, by you
For you I do
The faded piping on your press
Will always have its place I guess
By you, by you
A common love
That we can bless
The pleasure of
My child‚Äôs mess
Golden books
And tenderness
Have rescued me
From emptiness

You are, you are
The star I say
From far from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all to stay
You are you are
The star I say
From far, from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all, it all, it all, it all, it all to stay


Nevermind

Yo in the middle of June in the summer of '59
I was young and cool, shot a bad game of pool, and I hustled all the chumps I could find. Now they call me the swan cause I wave my magic wand and I loved all the women to death. I partied hard, packed a mean rod, and I'll knock you out with a right or left.

Nevermind the Pac Jam
Nevermind the Gap Band
Nevermind the Zapp Band
Nevermind the Funk Scam
Cause we're
The Red Hot Chili Peppers

Nevermind the English bands
Nevermind the Synth Funk bands
Nevermind the Wham Wham band
Nevermind Duran Duran
Cause we're
The Red Hot Chili Peppers

Nevermind the Soft Cell shit
That's strictly for the twits
Nevermind the Men At Work
Those tunes are for the jerks
Cause we're
The Red Hot Chili Peppers

Nevermind Hall and Oates
Those guys are a couple of goats
Nevermind the Culture Club
That jive's just one big flub
Cause we're
The Red Hot Chili Peppers


No Chump Love Sucker

She's a witch
A bat
A bonafide bore
What's more - she snores
And that is a fact
Cow eyes lie
Yes it's time to resist
How did I ever
Get into this
How could I ever
Have kissed that bitch
So what if she's
Got big tits

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

She came like a cat
Like a cat to catnip
She came in my lap
With her womanly hips
When I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
A blueblooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
Get the last laugh

She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit

Like two trains on one track
Bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were
Destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
You and your wack attack

Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker

No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker

No chump love sucker

I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that
The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
You dirty rat
She's a bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster

No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker


Nobody Weird Like Me

The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Living my life in and out of the twilight zone

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Intercourse with a porpoise is a dream for me
Hell bent on inventing a new species

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Riding down the path on the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed, 'cause I passed some gas

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Enchanted as a rabbit that my life is a dream
Well, everything is never, just as it seems

The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Living my life in and out of the twilight zone

On Mercury

I've got myself
In a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go
Shake it off
Just to redirect my flow
Come on let's go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block

Come again and tell me
What you're going thru
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due

Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
Come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
You always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew thru

Looking up into
A reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up
Another stubborn scorpio
Come on, let's go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block

Come again and tell me
What you're going thru
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really really you


One Big Mob

I am you are me, I am you are me
I am you are me, I am you are me
(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Good woman said, "You gotta believe"

(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Submerge into the urge of we
(I am you are me, I am you are me, I am you are me)
Deliciously, the mystery, the mystery

One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob is

Ooze into into my noodle, east or west shepherd or poodle
Lady bug, pine tree to mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun and a brother to the cool breeze
One big mob is

One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob is

We live in the city, we live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking a thimble humble
Everything you ever see is never more than you and me
Give it on into the beauty of the mystery
One big mob is all

One big mob in one big home, a broken home
I'd like to share some air with you, some air with you
A morning forest full of truths, the green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives to give and give

What was I thinking in my head? The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread, something I said
Checkmated by frustration, I need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost, a sullen cost

I am you are me, I am you are me
I am you are me, I am you are me
(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Good woman said, "You gotta believe"

(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Submerge into the urge of we
(I am you are me, I am you are me, I am you are me)
Deliciously, the mystery, the mystery

One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob is

Scrawled upon the wall of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note that spoke to all
One, two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me 'cause I might be you
One big mob is

One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob is

Picaboo street in Timbuktu
Do I need to repeat that a boy named Sue?
Rockin' to the beat of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet and forehead too
One big mob is


One Hot Minute

I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike

Am I all alone

She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss

Am I all alone

One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it (3x)
If I chase it I might waste it
Come and spin it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Oh maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Close your eyes
And click your heels
Can you believe
How good it feels

Am I all alone

One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it (3x)
If a chase it I might waste it
Come and spin it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Oh maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Three pounds of love
Inside my skull
A million more lives
It's never gone
Just a few times spun
Spun around the Sun
A couple more or less
And then we're done

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Oh maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire


Open, Close

So we were down in Brasil and
And that place is wild, we were in Rio de Janeiro
And we had this sort of a security guard, tough guy
And he was supposed to take us around
I said: hey could, you know, could you take us to the
The favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and
You know, the street life of your town
He said: sure so we, we pull up to this hooker and
She‚Äôs wearing some kind of a... A-a bright green mini skirt
And it turns out it‚Äôs a transexual
He says: get over here and she comes over and she thinks she‚Äôs busted.
But she‚Äôs not busted, no she‚Äôs not busted
He just wanted to smack her in the ass a few times
I and say, hey what‚Äôs up girl

I get out of bed
And I clear up my head
I don‚Äôt want to go
But I do it instead
We are dreams
Within a dream

I get into bed
And I turn off my head
I started to float
Was it something she said
We are dreams
Within a dream

So I remember we got our driver‚Äôs license
And my friend hillel had this little datsun painted green and in
Hollywood we get so crazy in the winter
The rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights and
Well you know we‚Äôd smoke weed and we‚Äôd go up in the hills
And we‚Äôd listen to progressive rock music
And just kind of trip out and
Well we were dreaming, you know, we were dreaming
And we were talking about what we wanted to do
And we were talking about girls and music and
You know, hillel wanted to be a rock star
I didn‚Äôt even know what that was and I was like:
Whatever you want to do man, I‚Äôm coming with you, I‚Äôm right with you my friend

I get out of bed
And I clear up my head
I don‚Äôt want to go
But I do it instead
We are dreams
Within a dream

I get into bed
And I turn off my head
I started to float
Was it something she said
We are dreams
Within a dream

Why in the world would you want it to be
Why would you wanna take it so, so literally
All this things that come down from the sky
Raining upon your head
Make me stop and wonder why
Can I just spell it out, make it clear
Make it easy to read
For the simple man like me?
I don‚Äôt think so
I reached out to my family and I said:
It‚Äôs not about religion and the God
Sitting in the chair in the sky
With a punishing hand, no
It‚Äôs about heaven in your heart
Now, when can we start?
I wanna choose love instead of fear
Won‚Äôt you come right now over here
And we come now
Let me make it easy this time
I love you

But there's a party in my town
And no beat box
Jam that is

The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped the doors unlocked

Otherside

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don‚Äôt
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs bad
A slit in my throat, it‚Äôs all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I‚Äôve got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I‚Äôve got to take it on the otherside

Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don‚Äôt
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs bad
A slit in my throat, it‚Äôs all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray‚Äôs full and I‚Äôm spillin‚Äô my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I‚Äôve got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she‚Äôs in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and I pull the thread
I‚Äôve got to take it on the otherside

Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don‚Äôt
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs bad
A slit in my throat, it‚Äôs all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it‚Äôs not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it‚Äôs born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don‚Äôt
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs bad
A slit in my throat it‚Äôs all I ever had

(How long?)
I don't, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs bad
A slit in my throat, it‚Äôs all I ever


Out In L.A.

We‚Äôre all a bunch of brothers
Livin‚Äô in a cool way
Along with six million others
In this place called L.A.

L.A.‚Äôs the place sets my mind ablaze
For me its a race through a cotton
Pickin‚Äô maze

The town makes me jump its got a lot
Of bad chicks
Well sure its got some chumps but I still
Get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick
The ripe pick
Like a thump on a thumb poppin‚Äô hump
Hump hump pop out

The action never stops I‚Äôm as wild as can be
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm shooting for the top and my
Best friend‚Äôs Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew that balls could pop
But he never met the tree so he never
Bebopped hop out

Antwan the swan from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper
You could tell he was strong
He wore a cold paisley jacket
And a hellified ass
And between his legs was a sweat young lass
He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he‚Äôd love them all
But by the time he got to 99 he had to stop
‚ÄòCause that‚Äôs when he thought
That he heard a fop
Night and the night before
I heard a fop outside then I
Came in doors rock out

Now I told you a little
Somethin‚Äô ‚Äòbout the Flea
Something ‚Äòbout the tree
A little something ‚Äòbout me
I can‚Äôt leave you hangin‚Äô
‚ÄòBout my man Sherm Zee
He swings the ying, he bangs the yang
Now its time to hear him do his thang
You better be burnin‚Äô Sherman

We‚Äôre all a bunch of brothers livin‚Äô
In a cool way
Along with six million others in this
Place called L.A.
Step out


Out Of Range

Leaving town to find the flower that I could deserve
Someone moves someones bound to get their feelings hurt
I'm loving you you're out of range
I wanted you you're out of range

As I walked out into the world I feel a sudden chill
I was bleeding pretty good onto a daffodil
I'm loving you you're out of range
Wanted to you're out of range

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya

I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times
Barely there your voice is cracking up across state lines
Loving you you're out of range
Wanted you you're out of range

Skies of ecstasy were breaking while I do believe
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks
I'm loving you you're out of range
Wanted to you're out of range

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya

I know it hurts when its taken away
I tell you that I could be leaving
Today with you or without you ok
Washed by the rain and its all gonna change

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya

No sir not to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya


Over Funk

Press start dirty 
It's 7:30 
Loss of might and 
Cat alertly
My best, your rest 
Send your call 
And then I nest 

Perversity in features 
Adversity the teachers 
Some call love more 

Soon I'll call the rhythm song 

It's over 
It's over now 
So long to doo-doo-ra 
It's over 
It's over now 
I dare not get a look 

Be yourself 
Some let her call 
Never fall 
See yourself 
Sit alone and wait 
To my own call 

Go ballistic 
Anarchistic 
Smack my mouth and 
Then you kissed it 
So long, my gun 
Simple run and 
Letter bum 

Things are looking good on paper 
Once when I was in your favour 
This kiss is a mess 
Send my girl riddle less 

It's over 
It's over now 
So long to riddle songs 
It's over 
It's over now 
I dare not read a song 

See yourself 
Sad, alone and wait 
To my own brawl 
Free yourself 
There's an only count 
This stands for all of them 

Just play at any tempo 
Going mad and going mental 
All balm, said no 

Just to let him put it wrong 

It's over 
It's over now 
So nice to get along 
It's over 
It's over now 
It's over 
It's over now


Parallel Universe

Deep inside of a parallel
Universe
It's getting harder and harder
To tell what came first

Under water where thoughts can breathe
Easily
Far away you were made in a sea
Just like me

Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything

Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my
A solar system that fits in your eye
Microcosm

You could die but you're never dead
Spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head
Fields of space, kid

Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything

Psychic changes are born in your heart
Entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart, girl

Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty Cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you

Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything


Party On Your Pussy

Well, my landlady, she lives three houses away
She claims that she can hear my baby screaming to me
‚ÄúFuck me‚Äù
Anthony, Anthony

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy

Struck by lust in a telephone booth
Busted by a cop; he said ‚ÄúThat's uncouth‚Äù
He said that she can hear my baby screaming to me
‚ÄúFuck me‚Äù
Anthony, Anthony

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy

Let me shine your diamond
The girl got a scratch
Slap that cat
Have mercy

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy


Pea

I'm a little pea
I love the sky and the trees
I'm a teeny tiny little ant
Checking out this and that
And I am nothing
So you have nothing to hide
And I'm a pacifist
So I can fuck your shit up!
Oh, yeah
I'm small
Oh, yeah
I'm small

Fuck you asshole!
You homophobic redneck dick
Big and tough and macho
You can kick my ass

So fucking what?!
So fucking what?!
So fucking what?!
So fucking what?!


Pink As Floyd

Say what you need to say
Make it clear
Make it great
Cause it‚Äôs not too late
And there‚Äôs no mistake
When you shine
Shake it for me anyway
Now we crash the gate
To investigate
Your fate

Pleasure to meet you
Got so much more
To offer the world
See what‚Äôs in store
Stay all day
Someone to love
That‚Äôs my boy chip chop
Open the doors
And we never close shop
Stay all day

Take what you need to take
To forsake
Make it for me anyway
When we fill the void
That is Pink As Floyd
To destroy
Records that we file away
Now I‚Äôll clean the slate
As I calculate
Your fate

Pleasure to meet you
Got so much more
To offer the world
See what‚Äôs in store
Stay all day
Someone to love
That‚Äôs my boy chip chop
Open the doors
And we never close shop
Stay all day

And you shine as you redefine
Your time, just another time of day
Do you feel the spark
When you play the part
Superstar
Fake it for me anyway
Time to tell them all
Without hem or haw
No applause
Tell them how to generate
How to raise the bar
How to keep it hard
To be alive, make it for me anyway
If you care at all
You will bare it all
You will grind, shake it for me anyway
Born to play the part
Dying for your art
Cuz it‚Äôs time
Take it for me anyway
You will clear the air
With a single stare
Your fate


Police Helicopter

Police helicopter sharking through the sky
Police helicopter landin‚Äô on my eye

Police helicopter takes a nosedive
Police helicopter no he ain‚Äôt shy

Police helicopter sharking through the sky
Police helicopter landing on my eye

Police helicopter don‚Äôt take no jive
Police helicopter no he ain‚Äôt shy


Police Station

Saw you at the police station
And it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes had wandered off
To something distant
Cold and grey
I guess you didn‚Äôt see it coming
Someone‚Äôs gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away
But we both know it‚Äôs somewhere

I saw you on the back page
Of some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes
Said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers
Not today
I send a message to her
A message that I‚Äôm coming
Coming to pursue her

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I‚Äôve got you 10 times over
I‚Äôll chase you down
Till you‚Äôre dead

I saw you on a TV station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper
Smiling was your money maker
Someone ought to situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way
Time to come and find you
You can‚Äôt hide from me girl
So never mind what I do

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I‚Äôve got you 10 times over
I‚Äôll chase you down
Till you‚Äôre dead
I met my soul mate country
And I left it all for your head

I saw you in the church yard
There was no time to exchange
You were getting married
And it felt so very strange
I guess I didn‚Äôt see it coming
Now I guess it‚Äôs me who‚Äôs bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get used to
So now I will refuse to

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soul mate country
And I left it all for your head
I‚Äôve got my best foot forward
And I chase you down till you‚Äôre dead


Porcelain

Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away

Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile
Can you bear not to share with your child
Drifting and floating and fading away

Little lune
All day
Little lune

Porcelain
Do you carry the Moon in your womb
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away

Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away

Little lune
All day
Little lune

Purple Stain

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Python power straight from my Monty
Celluliod loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free and I'm the patient

Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
And purple stain - I know

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with alligator haters
Did what you did-did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread

Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
And purple stain - I know
All if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's the way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where - I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there
But I don't care
'Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is and angel and I can prove this
Purple is the stain upon my pillow
Let's sleep weeping willow

Black and white red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
And purple stain - I know
All if I call you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's the way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where - I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there
But I don't care
'Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood


Quixoticelixer

Kick back and love it just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby but not yet sunk
How I listened low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold

Gravity free, is she, look at her
Highness on a mattress full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
Your smell or your go-to-hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it probably will not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how did I get
Your lipstick on my kite

I love this weather it's a perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keep me warm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form

Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Oh, lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind in a medicated state
Is a highly over-rated fate
Terrible, is it so what you told me
That there is such a thing?
Do you know that you glow when you go
From winter in the spring?

I love this weather it's a perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keep me warm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form

The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick get strong
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick get strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on fourth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick get

Kick back and love it just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby but not yet sunk
How I listened low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold

I swear to God I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you

I stand before this now, no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you

I swear to God I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to God I could not hurt you

I swear to God I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you

Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, oh
Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, oh
Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, oh

Red Hot Mama

A luscious bitch she is, true
But it's not nice to fool mother nature
The proud mother of god like all ho's
Is jealous of her own shadow
Who is this young Vic Tanny bitch
Who wish to be queen for a day?
Who would sacrifice the great grandsons and daughters of her jealous mother
By sucking their brain until their ability to think was amputated
By pimping their instincts
Until they were fat, horny and strung-out
In a neurotic attempt to be queen of the universe
Who is this bitch?

{sung:}
Red hot mama from Louisiana
Thumbin' her way to Savannah
She been cooped up too long

Red hot mama lookin' to the city
Taxi dancers and big time spenders
She's been groovin'

Red hot mama was gettin' down
Scoping the places where fun to be found
She was smokin'

Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me

Red hot mama was really bad
She was badder than bad, bad as she want to be

Red hot mama was a real gas
Doin' it good and doing it fast
She was smokin'

Whoa, {etc}!

Ride on red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
(Come on baby!)
Ride on red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
(Right on!)
Ride on red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me

Be my dog!
You look good, girl
Carry on!
Hey!
Get funky?

Hey baby
Be my dog

Come on, baby!
Red hot mama
Right on
Play, boy
Play on


Right On Time

One shot all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed
'Til death do us part
Break my heart so I can start

Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this

It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time it's right on time it's right on
time it's right on time
Lookin' fine you're lookin' fine get on 1999
It's right on time

Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow bow wow wow
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time it's right on time it's right on
time it's right on time
Lookin' fine you're lookin' fine get on 1999
It's right on time

Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row let us go
It's time to blow up for the show

All the world reverberated
Coming through we motorcaded
Vibrate when we operated
Turning up in solid stated

Oh, Lord!


Rivers Of Avalon

Deep inside these sleeping shallows,
Far away where no-one goes now,
Take my place in golden space
Of TV stars that no-one knows now,
Deep, deep mystery is talkin' to me,
She's the giver of constant animation,
All around and ready to make a new formation,
You're the reason I'm in this world...

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
Part of my scenery,
What I belong to is your ecstasy,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your faith unwavering is key,

The clone of my own loneliness
Has got to fade, what am I known to?
Little garland in your starling,
Loving waves that I've succumbed to,
Deep, deep mystery is talkin' to me,
She's the giver of constant adulation,
All around and ready to make a new formation,
You're the reason I'm this world...

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
Part of my scenery,
What I belong to is your ecstasy,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your faith unwavering is key,
What do you see in me?

Deep, deep mystery is talkin' to me,
She's the giver of constant animation,
All around and ready to make a new formation,
You're the reason I'm in this world...

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
Part of my scenery,
What I belong to is your ecstasy,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your faith unwavering is key,

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
All that it means...


Road Trippin'

Road trippin' with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It's time to leave this town, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost anywhere in the U.S.A.
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost...

Blue you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for...

So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf
Staying high and dry's more trouble than it's worth in the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These Smiling eyes are just a mirror for...

In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory's got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars, it's time to steal away
Let's go get lost right here in the U.S.A.
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost...

Blue you sit so pretty west of the one
Sparkle light with yellow icing just a mirror for the sun

Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for...
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for...
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for...


Rolling Sly Stone

I should be on my way
I really bought not stay
Far too strong with the pinnup on
Hear my conscience, "I'm gone!"

I should have let you know
This boy/ball was made to roam
The band is who I`m married to
And this is work I`ve set to do

I let my motor stray
Forgive me where I play
Sendin' my love to Tennessee
She got style now lets see

And remember, who
To surrender to
The captain of my ship is brave
It's brothers hood on a mothers day

Do do do dit do

Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

I'm off to wonderland
Just in my second hand
Life is short but it ain`t planned
I`m away outside but in demand

I'll take it on my chin
Go back and forth again
Find me on some telephone
With a broken down voice and a shake-ed tone

Do unto others who
You would have do to you
Ain`t no way I`d ever trade
That sparer life for this piece of shade

Destined for battle zone
Why's there no lesson known?
The lesson`s not to wait for me
Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet

Do do do dit do

Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

Bridge:
Let your jaw decide
Let your jaw divide
Everything we do

Let your motor ride
Let your motor ride
Everything we do

Oh! Help me!

Do do do dit do

Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

We could have made it our love
We could have skated through
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to


Runaway

Walking around, I love a town 
Walking it out, when you want to 
Soldiering my styling smiling 
Journey in do wherever I choosen 
Take me now to the water 

Don't be late I hear it 
Gonna get so very great and, 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway 
All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 

Kick it around, stare at the ground 
Break it down, when you want to 
Soldiering my days I chose on 
Dance around do wherever I want to 
Take me now, it's the water 

Don't be late I hear it 
Gonna get so very great and, 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway 
All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 

I think I know 
Everything you gonna say 
I think you know 
I wanna runaway 

Don't be late I hear it 
Gonna get so very great and, 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway 
All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 

All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway

Save The Population

History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong

Thinking of a drinking song the honkytonk will do
Making another breaking bone your favorite ingenue
This the distant dawn
This the distant dawn

I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One pixies broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

Stay all night
we'll save the population
Stay all night
we'll save the population
Stay all night
we'll save the population
Stay all night
we'll save the population

Pistol end its fawn
Sell it to the lexicon
A pistol landed hard
Lot on bottom lines be drawn

Take another bottle down to proper lam the shrew
Make another awful sound to rap the gothic through
History's so strong
History's so strong

I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One pixies broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down


Save This Lady

I Got More Love Than Anything Else 
But A Jezebelle Spirit Gonna Steal My Health 
Struck By The Notion That It Just Might Be 
A Method To The Madness That I Cannot See 

Something For The Freedom Of A Roughed-Up Soul 
For The Two Years Young Is A Little Bit Old 
Born Named Sue Sing A Tennassee Tune 
Got Buffalo Love Living On The Moon 

[Chorus] 
Save This Lady For Me [x4] 

Call Me Alabama I'm A Seminole Prize 
Got Time Square Hair And A Bedroom Eyes 
Keystone Cops And The Billy Bob Chops 
Gonna Scare My Kids Gonna Share My Crops 

Vampire Blood And A Baseball Love 
Justa A Little Bit Of What The Girl Is Made Of 
National Crash Into The Big Lampoon 
With A Creature Coming Up From The Black Lagoon 

[Chorus] 

Losing Ground True Sounds Of Liberty 
The Forest Of The North Might Hold The Key 

Rocking To The Rythm Of A Ragtime Band 
Black Flag Wave On On My Truck My Man 
Blasting For Jones And The Great Unknowns 
Got Cheap Cologne Seventy-Six Trombones 

Looking For The Lady That Won't Be Afraid 
When Heaven Needs A Hammer Gotta Get Things Made 
I Got More Love Than Anything Else 
But A Jezebelle Spirit Gonna Steal My Health


Savior

Dusting off your savior
You were always my favorite
Always my man - All in a hand

To celebrate you is greater
Now that I can - Always my man

Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand - All in a hand

Just like you 'cause you made me
All that I am - All in a hand

A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and any damage done
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came

Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior
He's just a man - All in a hand

Your hero's destined to waver
Anyone can - Always my man

I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand - Safe in your hand

You were always my favorite
Always my man - All in a hand

We are the red hots and
We're loving up the love me nots
The flowers in your flower pot
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and everything he does
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came

Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man


Scar Tissue

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share

Push me up against the wall
Young kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste you health, 'cause

With the birds I'll share

Blood loss in a bathroom stall
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to ma and pa, 'cause
With the birds I'll share

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view

This lonely view

Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl in
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

With the birds I'll share
This lonely view
With the birds I'll share
This lonely view
With the birds I'll share
This lonely view

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share

Search And Destroy

I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

Honey gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby detonate for me

Look out honey, 'cause i'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight

Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby penetrate my mind

And I'n the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin, searchin to destroy
And honey i'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin, searchin to destroy

Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy said forgotten boy


Self-Titled

Hoo, Lord !

Well, I'm gonna drive a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust

Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills

Well, I'm gonna drive a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
Just don't show me anything
'cos that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't kill coyotes

Well, I'm gonna drive a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills

Sex Rap

Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum

In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Push it all in and pull it all out
Pump that leman 'till it pouts

Open your legs to the sensual sound
With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hug the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good

In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb i strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum

Well I like to make her cum
To the rythm of the drums
Make cum, make cum, cum


Sexy Mexican Maid

Hair so smooth, black as coal
Aw baby the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue
That you take my blues away
She comes and goes that I know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist I kiss your lips
You're my sexy mexican maid

Let me please get on my knees
I come alone

When I wake up in the morn
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find it's a bright and sunny day
So serene she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say she's my sexy mexican maid

Let me please get on my knees

She puts me in a bubble bath
She tickles me and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean
Then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow
Then we make it very fast

Let me please get on my knees
Oh let me please


Shallow Be Thy Game

I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving god
We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is something worse
I do not serve
In fear of such a curse

Shallow be thy game
2000 years look in the mirror
You play the game of shame
And tell your people live in fear

A rival to the way you see
The bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival
And your control company

You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I'll be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

To anyone who's listenin'
You're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin

Missionary maddness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course
It's fucking rude

To think that you're above
The laws of nature is a joke
Purple sasfies feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke

I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and


She's Only 18

She's only 18
Don‚Äôt like the Rolling Stones
She took a short cut
To being fully grown

She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose

This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said: My man you know
It‚Äôs time to get your fingers wet
Your hustle‚Äôs busted when
You can‚Äôt afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming
Handle it

Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed

I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend

It‚Äôs in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I‚Äôm gonna make you mine

It‚Äôs understood you wrap
Your voodoo right around my neck
You‚Äôve got some glitter on your
Kitty at the discotheque
I put my lovin‚Äô in your oven
Now it's time to check
The last I heard from you
You were screaming
Resurrect!


She Looks To Me

Looks to me like heaven sent
No lullaby kid no 5 percent

Anyway you want to cut that cake
She's dyin' from the likes of abandonment

Lost in the valley without my horses
She need somebody to hold

It looks to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in
It's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn our way too much
Shootin' dope in the back
Of a cadillac jack

Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold

It looks to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

Down in the south seas
Give me your mouth please
Resuscitation
Is the way I find these
I give you major
You give me minor
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner
Now

Lost in the valley
Without my horses
No one can tell me
What my remorse is

God made this lady
That stands before me
She need somebody to hold

She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me she looks to me
All right

Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me she looks to me
All right

It looks to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me


Show Me Your Soul

In a world that can be so insane
I don't think its very strange
For me to be in love with you
I want to know more than your brain

Into my life you were injected
Not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection
We have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll
Don't be cold show me your soul

Sentimental gentlemen are not afraid
To show you when I am you
You're my best friend
Show me your soul

In a world that can...

Yes I find you so appealing
When you show me how you're feeling
You my friend need not be kneeling
Open up and stop revealing
Trust in me, my heart is whole
I need to see
Show me your soul

Sentimental gentlemen...

In a world that can...

Don't expect too much from me
Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be
I just like you, a human being
You won't offend, I need to know
Please my friend
Show me your soul.

Sentimental Gentlemen...


Sick Love

Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming: You're my home
Vanity is blasted, but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there?

I don't know, but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Stick 'n move, you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it, that's for sure

Rivers get connected
So much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern clich√©

People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir?
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick, you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail, my baby, it'll be your last

I don't know, but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Rivers get connected
So much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern clich√©

Rivers get connected
So much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern clich√©

Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray

Sir Psycho Sexy

A long, long, long, long time ago
Before the wind before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho

Sir Psycho Sexy, that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

Deep inside the Garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave me good reason
Booty lookin' too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' 'cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over archiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper

Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, he's the man that I met one time
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, he's the man that left me blind
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, he's the man he's the man he's theman
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, yea

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile
She said "Get out and spread your legs"
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy, I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "What's up?" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped "Ooo that's tight"
I swaited her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, he's the man that I met one time
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, he's the man that left me blind
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, he's the man he's the man he's theman
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yea, yea

Hello, young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you

Lay me down, lay me down lay, me down lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down lay, me down lay me down

Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right of the map
Ooh, and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while


Skinny Sweaty Man

Flashin' lots of cash and spendin' lots-o-loot
He's sitting at the bar - then he's sittin' at the booth
Across the dance floor he does scoot
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

The caboose that could he goes toot toot
Been known to gag and sometimes puke
A very good friend of granny goose
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Skinny sweaty man in the green suit

He's half man and half cartoon
But good buddy don't be confused
He's full blooded looney tune
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Face to face with the man in the moon
His family doctor is doctor seuss
If you catch him in your soup please don't shoot
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Skinny sweaty man in the green suit

He was new in town
A free wheelin' clown
A very funny young duke
Hangin' under the roof
Of a place in time
United sound

He'll play a little guitar sing a few blues
He's the kinda guy that you can't refuse
Despite the fact that he's no brute
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move
Like an eight legged freak in snakeskin boots
Coming soon to a theatre near you
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Skinny sweaty man in the green suit


Slow Cheetah

Waking up dead inside of my head
Will never never do there is no med
No medicine to take

I‚Äôve had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I‚Äôve had a chance to break

It‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake

Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away

Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it‚Äôs on today

Slow cheetah come
It‚Äôs so euphoric
No matter what they say

I know a girl
She worked in a store
She knew not what
Her life was for
She barely knew her name

They tried to tell her
She would never be
As happy as the girl
In the magazine
She bought it with her pay

Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it‚Äôs on today

Slow cheetah come
It‚Äôs so euphoric
No matter what they say

Everyone has
So much to say
They talk talk talk
Their lives away
Don‚Äôt even hesitate

Walking on down
To the burial ground
It‚Äôs a very old dance
With a merry old sound
Looks like it‚Äôs on today


Smells Like Teen Spirit

Load up on guns and bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self assured
Oh, no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello...

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah! Yay! Yay!

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello...

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
Yeah! Yay! Yay!

And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello...

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido

A denial - (9x)


Snow (Hey Oh)

Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe it, we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey, oh
Now listen what I say, oh

When will I know that I really can‚Äôt go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it‚Äôs killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it‚Äôs killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh
Whoa-whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it‚Äôs so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there‚Äôs nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go, oh

When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I‚Äôm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe it, we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh
Whoa-whoa

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it‚Äôs so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, hey, yeah, oh, yeah
Tell my lord now
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, oh, yeah
Tell my lord now

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah, oh, yeah


So Much I

Next stop on the KLM
Two lips and a sturdy stem
A funny thing always happens when
I get a heavy jam
I'm gonna turn it into hydrogen
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I

Cowgirl and a troubadour
MGM and the lion's roar
A straight shot to the corner store
I wanna show you what
I wanna show you what your head is for
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I

So much I, wish I could
So many I, wish I would
So much I, wish I could
Count on you not to complete me

So much I, wish I could
So many I, wish I would
So much I, wish I could
Count on you not to defeat me

Please don't turn away again
Please don't turn me into them
Please don't turn away a friend
Please don't turn me into them

Stand by for the great eclipse
Rip it out now shake your hips
Backing off the apocalypse
I gotta loosen up
I gotta loosen up to get my grip
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I

So much I, wish I could
So many I, wish I would
So much I, wish I could
Count on you not to complete me

Count on you not to defeat me

Please don't turn away again
Please don't turn me into them


Someone

Someone

There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for 

Nothing major or too complicated
Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated
For someone someone 

Cut my heart out 
With a feather
And put an end 
To any extra pressure 

For someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for 

Ride around on mellow waves of mercy
And fill the space with lack of controversy 

For someone
Someone 

Set it up to follow you
On my aeroplane
Here's a present
For the future memory lane 

Someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for 

Light it up the room
She sang into any twane
Hit 'em up cause you got me
A mop to your plane 

Someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for me 

For me 
For me
For me


Song That Made Us What We Are Today

Instrumental


Soul To Squeeze

I've got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze

Well all the love from thee
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams (yeah)
Have turned to demons of greed that's me

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said, please
I'll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be, oh, yeah

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Oh, so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh, make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction

It's bitter, baby
And it's very sweet
I'm on a rollercoaster
But I'm on my feet
Take me to the river
Let me on your shore
Well I'll be comin' back, baby
I'll be comin' back for more

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad

I could not forget
But I will not endeavor
Simple pleasures are much better
But I won't regret it never

Where I go I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Where I go, I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna keep you for the end of time


Sound And Vision

SOUND AND VISION 


 
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision ?

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live.
Blue, blue.

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue.

And I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sit
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision

Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision ?


Special Secret Song Inside

Well, my landlady, she lives 3 houses away.
She claims that she can hear my baby screaming to me "fuck me"
Every day, when I'm in the hay

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

Struck by lust in a telephone booth
Busted by a cop; he said "That's uncool"
He said that she can hear my baby screaming to me "fuck me"
Every day, when I'm in the hay

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want to party on your pussy, baby

I want to party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy
I want to party on your little pussy, girl
I want to party on your pussy

Let me shine your diamond
the girl got a scratch
slap that cat
have mercy

I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah


Stadium Arcadium

Bells around St. Petersburg
When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find

Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushin' a broom out into a space
And this where I find a way

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself and no
I don't mind asking now

Alone inside my forest room
And it's stormin'
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start

Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling

Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
The state of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself and no
I don't mind asking now

And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
The state of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself and no
I don't mind asking

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
To you


Stone Cold Bush

She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

Get up off your knees
Come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to life
I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

Haight Street got nothing to show
Except the skirt on your ass
When you're livin' on the streets you've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Awe everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that gut
You do it oh so well

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

She's got marble eyes
Sweet china doll her thighs
And animal in pain she starts to cry
Her pipes are open wide
She blows more than my mind
Echo sounds of soul time after time

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

Stranded,
Stranded on the toilet bowl,

Stranded on the toilet bowl,What do you do when you're stranded,
And there ain't nothing on the roll?To prove you're a man,
You must wipe it with you're hand,Stranded,
Stranded on the toilet bowl.


Strange Man

All of my love and
Most of my fears
Been coming on strong
For most of my years
Add up and end up in a song

Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams
Are blocking my shots and killin' my dreams
That showed me how to be the cause

Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, hey ah what now?

It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, I see
She wants to belong and, I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee

Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, yeah

All of my friends and enemies
They were part of this dance
That put me right here we go
So glad I got this chance

Better known plans
And lesser known schemes
Were all about love and less about me
I'd have to say she wore the pants

That's oh!

It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time for me, Uh-hu
She wants to belong and, I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee

Woo! Yeah
Ahh
Go
Oh
I've been left
(Can't figure out what he says next)
(And then a bunch of scat)

It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, lets see
She wants to belong and, I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee

It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's me
It's a long time, for me, uh-uh
She wants to be rich and, I want to be free
Keep your plans elastic 'cause there ain't no, guarantee


Stretch

Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favour of this motion

Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your hole

When it rains, I let myself get wet
I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother

Proposing to expose your head
Just something that is like no other

Hit it

I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out my friend
I'll stretch you out

The juice that flows from intuition is my liquid fare
We are all in favor of the open end
Three pounds of love and knowledge are expanding in my skull

Truth be told, we let the good times roll

I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And its making and creating love

Tender titillations

I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out my friend
I'll stretch you out

I'm a fish and I can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

Ow

There's a glowing up around the Moon it's showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing
Very legendary instraplanetary fairy

Varied truths
She's making just for you

Yes, I have always wanted to
Give something to this stranger

M-M-M-Moving to approve the groove
A mental transformation


Strip My Mind

Arthur J did indicate
The boulevard would never be
So full of love and life again

Hot as Hades early eighties
Sing another song and make me
Feel like I‚Äôm in love again

Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

All in favor sign the waiver
Bloody Carolina won't you
Take another look inside

Operator, co-creator
Come on radiator won't you
Blow another top and sing

El Dorado won the lotto
All that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through


Subway To Venus

Step right up and listen please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Everybody gather around
All aboard the underground
You've got to get in before you get out
And gettin' out is what it's gonna be about
If you find that you are blind
Open up your bashful mind

Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride
Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride

With honest sounds I'll paint your brain
For in this song I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip you'll ride for free
As we leave our trailer spots
Outer space is not some pot

This axis bold as love you see
Comes and goes so easily
This axis bold as love you see
Comes and goes so easily

Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus

Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw, be my quest inside my groove
'Cause what I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you wanna bunga-lee-loo
Make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm

Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll

Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus

'Cause what I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you wanna bunga-lee-loo
Make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Take your body shake it around
Do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants

Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus

Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing
Subway to Venus


Suck My Kiss

Most motherfuckers don't give a damn

Do you want me, girl, to be your thief?

Oh, baby, just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to

Stick with this

Sunday, Bloody Sunday

I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away

How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
Tonight we can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
And bodies strewn across a dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost but tell me who has won?
The trenches dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV is reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

I wipe the tears from your eyes
I wipe your tears away
I wipe your tears away
I wipe your tears away
I wipe your bloodshot eyes

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday


Taste The Pain

Flat on my back in a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling, 'cause I cannot fall
Asleep tonight
No, not at all

Head lights flash across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open, 'cause I cannot fall
In love with you
No, not at all

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid?
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid?
Funny how the price gets paid

Busted in two like a brittle stick
I can not drink, because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do

Open my mouth, I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream, you know I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid?
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid?
Funny how the price gets paid

This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk, I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I am not alive

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid?
Funny how the price gets paid

Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid?
Funny how the price gets paid

How the price gets paid
Well I got to pay, I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away
'Cause I couldn't survey, I couldn't pay
I couldn't price


Tear

This is my time
This is my tear
I can see clearly now
That this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time
This is my tear

Comin' on strong
Baudelaire
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime

All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end than end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know

Devil may cry devil may care
Distiller's got a scream
And now I know just why
When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time
California skies
Got room to spare
This is my time

Take it outside
Take it out there
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time


Tearjerker

My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth
Would not be true
Refuse the news

I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I
Supposed to do?
Just lose and lose

First time I saw you
You were sitting
Backstage in a dress
A perfect mess

You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love

Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so

I liked your whiskers
And I liked the
Dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes

You painted pictures
'Cause the one
Who hurts
Can give so much
You gave me such


Tell Me Baby

They come from every state to find
Some dreams are meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do

No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue

Come and get it, lost it at the city limits
Say goodbye cause they will find the way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute

This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's only promising
This place was made on you

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
Tell me lover, are you lonely
The thing we need is never all that hard to find out
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where do you come from and where you want to go this time on
You're so lovely, are you lonely
Or giving up on the innocence you left behind

Some claim to have the fortitude
To shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed

I move you like a baritone
Jungle brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

Chitty, chitty, baby, when your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet but life can be a little shitty
What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City
Lookin' for a hundred but you only ever found a fi'ty

Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
Tell me, lover, are you lonely
The thing we need is never all that hard to find out
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
You're so lovely, are you lonely
Or giving up on the innocence that you left behind, behind

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
Tell me, lover, are you lonely
The thing we need is never all that hard to find out
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
You're so lovely, are you lonely
Or giving up on the innocence that you left behind


Tellin' A Lie

Would you believe that I‚Äôm tellin' a lie?
Would you believe that it‚Äôs just a disguise?
I don‚Äôt invent myself to shelter cause the fame won‚Äôt kill me
The shame the game the lame
Broken rapture

You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime

Would you believe?
I would convince myself to hide but not to be with someone else
You crazy bastard
Would you believe that I‚Äôm tellin‚Äô a lie?
Would you believe what you see in my eye?

You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime

Would you believe that I‚Äôm tellin‚Äô a lie?
Would you believe that I cut you out?
I couldn‚Äôt tear myself of hatred from the loaded masses
It‚Äôs all it‚Äôs all a game, your crazy bastard

You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime


The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie

Lipstick junkie
Debunk the all in one, she
Came back wearing a smile
Lookin' like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one here is on trial
It's just a turnaround
And we go, oh
And then we go oh oh oh oh

Tic toc I want to
Rock you like the 80's
Cock blockin' isn't allowed
Tugboat Sheila
Is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd
We better get it on the go

Hey now
We‚Äôve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

Hey now
We‚Äôve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

Rain dance Maggie
Advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods
Little did I know her body
Was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit

Hey now
We‚Äôve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

You've got the wrong girl
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone girl

Hey now
We‚Äôve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Oh Maggie makes it a cloud

I said: Hey now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone 'bye 'bye 'bye yeah
'Bye 'bye 'bye girl


The Getaway

That‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Take me through the future
It‚Äôs time, you‚Äôre fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture

You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let‚Äôs go, you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it to my ride

You don‚Äôt have to keep it if it‚Äôs mine
(Another lonely superstar)
(To get away inside your car)
Another place, maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside)
(A lover that another tried)

Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let‚Äôs steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner

Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no, we can‚Äôt be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it to my ride

You don‚Äôt have to keep it if it‚Äôs mine
(Another lonely superstar)
(To get away inside your car)
Another place, maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside)
(A lover that another tried)

That‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It‚Äôs time, you‚Äôre fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it to my ride

A May December might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar)
(To get away inside your car)
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside)
(A lover that another tried)

Don‚Äôt be late 'cause you‚Äôre my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden Gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays


The Greeting Song

Drivin' around I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

Makin' my way I brake another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love

Who, you talkin' to, talk to me you
Sound of music
Who, you talkin' to, talk to me you
Sound of music

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me

Sought and I found a life of makin my blood sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound the face of God is in sensoround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

Who, you talkin' to, talk to me you
Sound of music
Who, you talkin' to, talk to me you
Sound of music

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me


The Hunter

Woke up this morning like I always do
I still like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay

Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me, I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay

Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me, I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me, I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea


The Longest Wave

Throw me all around
Like a boomerang sky
Whatever you do, don't tell me why
Poppies grow tall, then say bye bye
The wave is here

A seamless little team and then we tanked
I guess we're not so sacrosanct
The tip of my tongue, but then we blanked
The wave is here
Waiting on the wind to tell my side

Ready, set, jet, but she never gets far
Listen to your skin from the seat of my car
Two centipedes stuck in one glass jar
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind to tell my side

What you want?
What you need?
Do you love?

Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day

Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

Sterile as the barrel of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin and half my age
Hotter than the wax on a saxifrage
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind to turn my page

Steady your sails for the butterfly flap
Whatever you do, don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman, but she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim

What you want?
What you need?
Do you love?

Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day

Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

Now I know why we came
Now I know


The Power Of Equality

I've got a soul that can not sleep
At night when something just ain't right
Blood red but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red, black or white this is my fight
Come on courage let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is Peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

Right or wrong my song is strong
You don't like it get along
Say what I want do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief, you menace me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me? Am I clear?
My name is Peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

I've got tapes, I've got CD's
I've got my Public Enemy
My lilly white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo he's with me and what I do
Ny name is Peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality

Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget 'cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No I can not get to this
People in pain I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot

Little brother do you hear me?
Have a heart, oh, come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
What ever happened to humanity
What ever happened to humanity
What ever happened to humanity


The Righteous & The Wicked

I can't rest in war
Will you be my friend
Dark ages never change
I can't comprehend

Kiss me we self destruct
Can you hear me Lord
Yes I think we're fucked
But I can't rest in war

The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist
Of the human beast
P.O.P.
Prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
I am praying for a better day

Oh, yeah
Playing for a better day
Anyway
Oh yeah, ahn, playing for a better day

Holy mother earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
Before she has been raped

Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global abortion peace
That is what she needs

The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist
Of the human beast
P.O.P.
Prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
I am playing for a better day

Oh, yeah
Playing for a better day
In the way

Are we fire flies
Flashing in the night
Big thunder rumble fish
Did you get it right

Headstrong battle song
Exploding souls be gone
Marvin Gaye my love
Where did we go wrong

The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist
Of the human beast
P.O.P.
Prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
I am praying for a better day, yeah

One, two
Rank it, that's it?


The Sunset Sleeps

Floozies at the rainbow
Superstars that won't get far
Who is who that we know
Coochie coo is at the bar

Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you want to make the call
We all long, we all fall

Shoelace for the sirens
Groupies and the tyrants ply

Do you really want
Do you want do you want
Do you want to have it all
We all long, we all fall

I'm so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way

Suitcase of perception
Rhinestones and redemption cries

(Omitted from final song)
Feast your eyes on stardom
A sacred strip that never lies

Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you want to make the call
We all long, we all fall

I'm so tired
The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way

Do you really love
Do you love do you chase
Do you take this town today
We all long, we all face

(Added to final song)
I'm so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
And I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way

The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
A perfect world
with all its perfect places
I could use a few
For just in cases

And I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way


The Zephyr Song

Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on?
Take a look, it's on display for you
Coming down? No, not today

Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pickin‚Äô up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We‚Äôll find a place together
Fly on my wind

Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down? No, not today

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We‚Äôll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We‚Äôll find a place together

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, do you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, won't you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We‚Äôll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We're gonna live forever

Forever

Thirty Dirty Birds

Thirty dirty birds
Sitting on a curb
Chirping and Burping
And eating
Dirty earthworms

Along comes Herbie
From thirty-third
And third
Saw the thirty
Dirty birds
Sitting on a curb
Chirping and Burping
And eating
Dirty earthworms
Boy he was
Disturbed


This Is The Kitt

This is the kitt, I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute I do declare
Let's sing a new revival

Chemical circus at the pub
Mentally she's departed
Cut me a check I'll cut your rug
Later we'll get bombarded

'Cause everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is the always red
In your wedding bed
Oh, everybody knows

Officer please I just got there
Travelled from door to door
Haven't you seen my girlfriend's hair
What are we looking for

And everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows
The day is full of highs and lows
Is the always red
In your wedding bed
Oh, everybody knows

Talk to me

This is the kitt I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute I do declare
I think we have our bible

Everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is the always red
In your wedding bed

Take me to the shore
Show me what it's for
Is there always red
In your wedding bed?

Everybody knows
This game is full of cons and pros
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows


This Is The Place

This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything is slow
Can I get some vaseline?
Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you

This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene?
Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it but I gotta know

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you

I saw you out there yesterday
What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you wanna say?
A masterpiece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean
I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake it but I gotta know

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you

I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray
A mash of DNA
Another poppin' Jay who thinks he's got something to say


This Ticonderoga

I met a man in a rock and roll band
He said: Won't you come with me?
I let him know that I could not go
You see, I get mine for free

We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite

Step inside the emotional ride
I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary
I call my best friend Flea

This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown, between us there are lines

Yes, I told her that
I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day?
I would not have it any other way, well

Means so much to me
Can you see the we?
What are we ever gonna do?
When all I want to be is next to you

I took a girl from the underworld
And I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done
She was not up for the fight

We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind

It's my favorite
So I savor it
I must report that life is short
So of your love I'll take ten quarts, well

There's no end to this
Don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent
For sitting on my elephant and

Am I crazy to
Join the lazy zoo?
All these human butterflies and
Cactus flowers swollen eyes and

I want the devil's share
Of you, I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do
When all these animals want
To be just like you

I met a girl with long black hair
And she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil
And I picked her for my bride

We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right

Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right


This Velvet Glove

Close to my skin
I'm falling in
Someone who's been

Sittin' by the phone
I'm left alone
In another zone

John says to live
Above hell
And my will is well

No one is waiting
For me to fail
My will could sail yeah

It's such a waste to be wasted
In the first place
I want to taste the taste of
Being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun
'Cause there is one
Knows where I'm from

I care for you
I really do
I really do

Come closer now
So you can lie
Right by my side

Sittin' alone in the sun
I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Close to my skin
Someone who's been
I'm falling in

Disasters are
Just another star
Falling in my yard

John says to live
Above hell
My will is well

Long to be with
Someone to tell
I love your smell


Throw Away Your Television

Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for it's collision now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old

Throw away your television
Make a break big intermission
Recreate your super vision now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old

Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now

Throw away your television
Take the noose off your ambition
Reinvent your intuition now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old

Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now

Throw away your television
Salivate to repetition
Levitate this ill condition now
It's a repeat, it's a repeat
It's a repeat, it's a repeat
It's a repeat

I said, don't you ever leave


Time

Time

I was walking 
through a courtyard
without shoes and 
without regard 
automatic catacombs
take me where I wanna go 

All around 
all in faces 
it astounds 
and amazes 
good to last innatural 
touch me I'm a chromosome 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time 
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
time 

Ultra-fine and ultralistic 
can I spy into the mystic 
system down for infiltration 
open mind free of frustration 

I was driving 
to a safe place 
and arriving
as I retraced 

Yell into a telescope 
aim it at the star of hope 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
time 

All over the under 
the smell of blood and thunder 
I'm connected by the lightning rod
giving into the beauty and 
heaven knows how well I know you 

Ultra-fine and ultralistic 
can I spy into the mystic 
system down for infiltration 
open mind free of frustration 

All around 
all in faces 
it astounds 
and amazes 
good to last innatural 
touch me I'm a chromosome 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
time 

All over the under 
the smell of blood and thunder 
I'm connected by the lightning rod 
giving into the beauty too and 
heaven knows how well I know you 

Time. . .


Tiny Dancer

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today


Torture Me

Because I‚Äôm happy to be sad
I want it all I want it bad
Oh-oh ‚Äì it‚Äôs what I know

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin‚Äô me so torture me

All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go ‚Äì it's what I know

The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill
Let‚Äôs go...

Let‚Äôs turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound
Is so...

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
It‚Äôs so...


Transcending

You are my God, you are my dog
You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said fuck off
Said you brothers a real punk rocker

Somthings gonna happen
Somthing very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me over the moon

Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall

Thats all

Always be loving you, now im away from you
Always be loving you

Round and round inside your head
Smartest fucker i ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul

Somthings gonna happen
Somthing very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me over the moon

Mule donkey ass you bore a load
Of all creations tortured souls
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall

Like no other, i love you your my brother
Like no other, i love you your my brother
Like no other, i love you your my brother
Like no other, i love you your my brother
Like no other, i love you your my brother
Like no other, i love you your my brother

Water flowing and i will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood, will never be understood

Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey mother may I have lost a child
But she gave birth
To a loving stream

Ooh, never know
When the gods will come and take you
To a loving stream

Ooh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were
From your loving stream

In a loving stream

Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream

Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In the loving stream


True Men Don't Kill Coyotes

Well, I'm gonna ride a Sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood Hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yea that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt and I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Riding wild on a Paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood Hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood Hills

Well, I'm gonna ride a Sabertooth horse

Just don't show me anything
'Cause that's the way I feel
Well I dig the dirt and I dig the dust

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
And blood never lies
Pale face die

Turn It Again

Some of us get a little
And some a lot
We've got to make due
With what ever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around

You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
Is turning night into day

Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again

I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten

Lace boots and the
Ladies of kasakstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then aruba then the dominican

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go, all we know (two things I want to say now)
Heavy load, start to float (you make it all ok now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)

We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh

I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key
And then I turn it for free

We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling derbish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot
Doin' the astronaut

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go, all we know (two things I want to say now)
Heavy load, start to float (you make it all ok now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)


Under The Bridge

Sometimes I feel like
I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like
My only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets, 'cause
She's my companion
I walk through her hills, 'cause
She knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and
She kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

It's hard to believe that
There's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away


Universally Speaking

I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still, I so admired
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me shewolf style
Rip right through me

Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her
I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight

Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her
I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her
I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Let's go


Venice Queen

Does it go from east to west yo
Body free and a body less yo
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime

Dropping in coming through the mesh yo
Checking in just to get it blessed yo
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free the roam
Where you come from?
Where you going?

Where you come from?
Where you going?

Do it all then it all again yo
Make it up and you make a friend yo
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas

Take a chance on a recommend yo
Hard as hell just to comprehend yo
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
Where you come from?
Where you going?

Where you come from?
Where you going?

We all want to tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best i've ever seen
We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best i've ever

I know you said you don't believe
In god do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend

Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend

And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of what I know?
Where would I be without you Glo
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend

I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
A kiss goodbye before you leave
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend


Victorian Machinery

Janey
You're my victorian machinery
(Breathe yourself to life)
Later
Your tender shape is pinning like the scenery
(Ride you like a bike)

You be the sail baby and
I'll be the rudder
We could make it all day
Untill it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will love you forever
When I heeded your call
In every heavy endeavour
I'll keep your place, ooh

Janey
Coming down the mouth, you're like a buffalo
(See it in your eyes)
Crazy
But then again, a girl could like it rough, you know
(Makes up for her size)

You be the sail baby and
I'll be the rudder
We could make it all day
Untill it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will feel you forever
When I heeded your call
In every heavy endeavour
I'll keep your place
Be yourself
When I saw, yeah
You be the shack
And baby I'll be the desert
There is nothing to like
When there is nothing to measure
It's all our space, wooh

You are my victorian machinery
Nah nah nah nah nah, wooh

Janey
Make a fist and knock me on the mood again
(Leave yourself to lie)
Later
Make me feel like I want more than you again
(Rock me like the vibe)
Crazy
Sing along just like they do in Budapest
(On the other rise)

You be the shack
And baby I'll be the desert
There is nothing to like
When there is nothing to measure
It's all our space


Walkabout

I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all bout
(and that ain't hard)

Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet

A detective of perspective I
I need to try to get a bigger eye
(open wide)

Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout, in a sunny daze
(do me now)

On a walkabout
You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in a desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

High desert skies are what I spy
So fly - you've got to wonder why

The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear

The digirido original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigene

On a walkabout
You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkbout

A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
(one ... two)

I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about
(can't hurt to try)

Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side


Walkin' On Down The Road

Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'Cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
I'm walkin' on down the road

Groovin' a tune straight out of the womb
'Cause trust is a must to be a true blue dude
That's a matter of fact don't be confused
Everybody knows true friends are few

Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody thinks, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'Cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
And I'm walkin' on down the road

Like a momma bear hugs her baby bear cubs
A dude he can't lose when he lives on love
Like the bark on a tree
Like the skin on my knees
I'm standin' by my blood

Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody thinks, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody thinks, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'Cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
I'm walkin' on down the road
I'm walkin' on down the road
I'm walkin' on down the road


Warlocks

Warlocks in wonderland
I‚Äôve gotta megatropolis in my hand
And a... subterranean marching band
Makin‚Äô noise for the boys in the Vatican
And a

A little package and off we go
Oh... ticky ticky tackita tic tac toe
I know... everybody‚Äôs Eskimo
We‚Äôve got another thing coming
And that‚Äôs our show... well

Every night I go looking for you
Everyone in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it‚Äôs what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in

Lilacs and contraband
I‚Äôve got Santa Monica in my hand
A little... Beatlemania when I can
And I‚Äôve got two big bags of old Japan

Ring side and blow-by-blow
Another... main event at the old rainbow
Were comin‚Äô... Right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot

Make a deal with Uncle Weezer
Sign your name to claim
China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane

Warlocks in wonderland
I‚Äôve gotta... Rockapotomus in my hand
With a‚Ä¶.Happy ending that‚Äôs made of sand
With a little bit of lovin‚Äô is all I can


Warm Tape

Shiver for me girl
Deliver for me my darling
Pushin' up to you
A river that runs right thru you
Swim for your smile
In a blue rock quarry
Make it for me baby
You won't be sorry
Shiver for my now
Deliver for me my darling

Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the waters of love
Two of us were made of angels dust
I've been around
But not around enough

Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm

Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the waters of love
Two of us were made of angels dust
I've been around
But not around enough

Let's go
I know, I make it for two and if
Intuitions only what you take from it
I know, I make it for two and if
You were there and I was fortunate
I know, I make it for two and if
Messy bed a part of cheating
I won't fall for you
I know I make it for two
I make it for two
I make it for two and

Shiver for me now
Deliver for me my darling
A living that I could
Be giving to you my sweet love
Swim for your smile
In a blue rock quarry
Make it for me baby
You won't be sorry
Shot from the pages of
Love and glory
Sleeping next to you
And I'm in your dream

Settle for love
Settle for love
Settle for love


Warped

(My tendency for dependency is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see to be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me)

So much love, so rare to dare
Afraid of ever being there
Take me home, I need repair
Take me, please, to anywhere

Descend
All the way
All the way

Descended from demented men
Struggle with the art of Zen
Please don't look too close at me
You might not like what you see

Descend
All the way
All the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there
Of being there

Craving sends me crawling, oh
Beg for mercy, does it show?
A vacancy that's full of holes
Hold me, please, I'm feeling cold

Descend
All the way
All the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there
Of being there


We Believe

The curtain
Is open
A head to
Put dope in
Now we will
Come clean it
The future
We've seen it
No, no, I know, I said, no, no

It's like a dream
That falls away
Into the night
Where we can play
I'm on a train
One happy day
Two eyes for sight
Three times I pray

Soda pop
We've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes
We've got a pressure drop
We don't know
But everyday I go
To see what I can bring
Into a cameo
Oh oh oh no

We believe
We believe
We believe (climb a tree for monkey business, write a check out to forgivness)
We believe (all the world on half an Acre, pushing dirt into a quaker)

The mission
The method
The downfall
Arrested
'Cuz it's not
The first time
Nor is it
The worst time
No no oh no

To see the bird
Without a care
For in a word
It's nice out there
In a tree
My mama bear
Will be all right
With proper care

Hey hey hey do

Boomerang
Into a bigger bang
A little cry of love
Because they cannot sing
Cherokee
What did the pharaoh see
Another time and space
Another place to be

We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe (climb a tree for monkey business, write a check out to forgivness)
We believe (all the world on half an Acre, pushing dirt into a quaker)
We believe (climb a tree for monkey business, write a check out to forgivness)
We believe (all the world on half an Acre, pushing dirt into a quaker)

The motive
The measure
The purpose
The pleasure

The risk is
It worth it
The disc is
It perfect

I found you
Amongst them
The flower
With young stem

Disparage
The broken
The marriage
Alopin'


We Turn Red

We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It‚Äôs the craziest thing I‚Äôve ever seen

Lost my mind ‚Äôcause I‚Äôm on the plastic
Who knew it‚Äôs so damn drastic?
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all your teeth in

Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night ‚Äôfore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Send it off through Delaware, just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind

Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let‚Äôs be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire

Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad‚Äôs got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desperado

Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night ‚Äôfore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

Send it off through Delaware, just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind

Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I‚Äôm the right one for the ride

Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?

We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It‚Äôs the craziest thing I‚Äôve ever seen


Wet Sand

My shadow side so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary, son, but it‚Äôs so

My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent, why do you care
Someone start the car
Time to go, you‚Äôre the best I know

My sunny side has up and died
I‚Äôm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low

The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

My what a good day
For a walk outside
I‚Äôd like to get to know
You a little better baby
God knows that I really tried

My what a good day
For a take out bride
I‚Äôd like to say we
Did it for the better of

I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary, son, but its so

The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty
Going toe to toe

My what a good day
Just to let it slide
I‚Äôd like to say we did it for the better of

I thought about it
And I brought it out
I‚Äôm motivated by the lack of doubt
I‚Äôm consecrated, but I‚Äôm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

Right on the verge, just one more dose
I‚Äôm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn‚Äôt perfect, but its close

I‚Äôm almost there, why should I care
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up and
Let it show

My what a good day
For a walk outside
I‚Äôd like to think we did it for the better of

I thought about it
And I brought it out
I‚Äôm motivated by the lack of doubt
I‚Äôm consecrated, but I‚Äôm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

You don‚Äôt form in the wet sand
You don‚Äôt form at all
You don‚Äôt form in the wet sand
I do Yeah
You don‚Äôt form in the wet sand
You don‚Äôt form at all
You don‚Äôt form in the wet sand
I do


What It Is

What It Is


Give it up to this time full of strife
Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life
Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight
At the never ending ocean of perfect insights
'Round your molecule beam with a halo of light
The animated aura will give delight
Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight

With the power of It, we are about to astound
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound
"Listen very close," my inner voice expounds
"We are the human race, and we groove to the sound"
Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth
A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth
People have to know that it's not about money
Cash is not the way to make your life sunny
There is no need if you got the soul seed
Love, life and peace, it can only begin
When you know in your heart that the change is within
Love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the missus and love all the misses
And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses
Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses

What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

Balance your life with the right kind of foods
To eat a sad cow is to eat another you
Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude
It'll put your Karma in the worst of moods
Someone's drinking booze and taking too many ludes
'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude
And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you
So please y'all, take some sound advice
Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice
The always sober you is especialy nice

Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot
I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute
Refuse to fight wars for political whores
Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores
It is my notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean
The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion
There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher
"Good morning class, how very nice to meet you"

What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

Open up your hearts to the planets; to the stars
With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars
You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid
Now, Albert lives forever in every single kid
But, with Adolph Hitler, we are permanently rid
Picasso, Mister Dali and my man, Jimi Hendrix
These cool brothers make the world go 'round
Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimy did it with sound
But, by all these men, it was found
Each and every person can be just as renowned
Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face afrown
Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down
Go spread the word from town to town
We are the human race and we groove to the sounds

Now that you've heard what it is in a song
From here on in, you can do not wrong


Whatever We Want

I stole your haircut and 
Your balling personality 

The perfect pallet for 
A painting of morality 

And now I come across without 
A loss of what to be 

Add up the two of us and 
Then subtract the one of me 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 

I'll turn you into one and 
Then i'll turn you out for fun 

Older than days and age 
In fact you never were that young 

Decended from a line 
Of endless oppotunities 

I'll build a mountain will 
You bring it down and ruin it please 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 
A sweet super tiger 
Won't it be great 

We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 

We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 
We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 

I'm dreaming up the thing 
That no one ever knew was love 

I'll get your higher than the 
Hawks of Hollywood above 

It's up for grabs the ragged 
String of possibilites 

To walk away from this could 
Leave me feeling ? 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 
A sweet super tiger 
Won't it be great 

We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
We could all to 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 

We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 
We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 
A sweet super tiger 
Won't it be great 

We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 

We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 
We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to


Why Don't You Love Me

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whispered sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin' and I don'tknow why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths

I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't knowwhy...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
Take the ball...

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shue
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whispered sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin' and I don'tknow why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths

I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't knowwhy...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths


Wonder Woman

[written by Charles Fox &amp; Norman Gimble , originally performed for the TV series 'Wonder Woman']
 
           Tricky: 
She's so malicious and so delicious  
Superstitious super suspicious  
Wonder woman under woman  
Only woman lonely woman  
You just rewind and we'll just be fine  
We'll just be fine you just be mine  
You just rewind and we'll just be fine  
You just be mine y ou just be mine  

     John Frusciante: 
You show me everything  
You fill me everywhere  
Your preaching that you care  
Do you care  

I'll fix to fall through time  
I knew your weren't mine  
I'll shine right through the sky  
Floating I try and try  
Captured by what I lose  
That' when I forced the flew  
Being will never be  
Have her remembering me  
 
            Tricky: 
Tuck your hair behind you ears  
Your tears and your silly fears  
I'll be your teddy bear  
You chose the clothes I wear  
For you I suffer much pain  
Sharp glass migraine  
For you I'd lose my focus  
For you I'd swim a swarm of locusts  

       John Frusciante: 
You show me everything  
You fill me everywhere  
Your preaching that you care  
Do you care  

Everytime I am you  
I feel forever new  
Posing along the beat  
You feel like I me  
If I were myself right now  
I wish I never found  
I'm holding on so tight  
Feeling like not feeling right  

You show me everything  
You fill me everywhere  
Your preaching that you care  
Do you care  

       Tricky: 
Here I remain  
She don't know my name  
Would she love me  
If I had real fame  
I feel bad pain  
Here come that rain  
I don't complain  
She's too complex  
Tell me your name  
Is that your real sex


Yertle The Turtle

On a far away island
of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me

With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule

Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said "I beg
Your pardon king Yertle"
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
"Silence !" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'
Little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle
Oh marvelous me for
I am ruler of all that I see

Yertle, Yertle the turtle...
Yertle, Yertle the turtle...


You're Gonna Get Yours

Ooh Chuck, they outta get us man
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off

In this corner with the 98
Subject of suckers - object of hate
Who's the one some think is great
I'm that one - son of a gun
Drivin' by - wavin' my fist
Makin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this
Top gun - never on the run
They know not to come cause they all get some
Goin' quicker in the speedin' lane
Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain

Caught in my smoke - all they did was choke
Look at my spokes - you know I'm no joke
Out that window - middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
Suckers they got the nerve and gall
To talk 'bout the car when they're walkin' tall

Chorus:
Suckers to tha side
I know you hate my 98
You gonna get yours (x2)

Pullin' away - every day
Leavin' you in the dust
So you know I get paid - on the mile ego trip
And 5-o tailin' on my tip
Watch me burn rubber - fall in my flame
This episode is always the same
Seein' no comp comin' like I'm blind
All left back - trailin' my behind
I go faster cops try to shoot me
They'll get theirs when they try to get me
I'll let it go - my turbo
Run, I'm in the river cause they're movin' too slow
Laughin' hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charged me contempt
I'd run my Boomerang - 'cause I'm feelin' proud
And I wouldn't even hear them cause my radio's loud

Chorus (x2)

Cruisin' down the boulevard
I treated like some superstar
You know the time so don't look hard
Get with it - the ultimate homeboy car
All you suckers in the other ride
Wherever I'm comin' get you my side
My 98 is tough to chase
If you're on my tail - better watch your face
Smoke is comin' when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
A tinted window - so super bad
Lookin' like the car the Green Hornet had
It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
It's the reason I left them back
It's the reason all the people say
My 98-O blows 'em all away

My 98 Oldsmobile is...
My 98 Oldsmobile's so...
My 98 Oldsmobile is...
My 98 Oldsmobile's like...

Chorus (x2)

Understand - I don't drive drunk
My 98's fly - I don't drive no junk
No cop gotta a right to call me a punk
Take this ticket - go to hell and stick it
Put me on a kick butt - line up, times up
This government needs a tune up
I don't know what's happenin' - what's up
Gun in my chest - I'm under arrest
Sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Took their girls and got them to thrill me
Stepped outside - got in my ride
Drove them around an' I looked around town
Caught 'em out there cold - ran 'em over and down
They didn't get me and that's the truth
Cause the 98-O is bullet proof

My 98 Oldsmobile's so...
My 98 Oldsmobile is...
My 98 Oldsmobile's so...
My 98 Oldsmobile's like...

You always sing the same

You always sing

Your Eyes Girl

I'm afraid that i'm never afraid
I've got combat boots
And i'm american made
For your eyes girl

Mormon lover on a delicate day
Gonna marry the boss
Get carried away
War cries girl

I'm not immune to canadian snow
Now teach me everything
That i should know
With your eyes girl

Freeze on the radio
I've got to leave and more
Freeze on the radio
I've got to bleed into snow
Hold on
Let go
We know

Do you shine like a temple inside
Can i open your core
So gentle and wide
Like your eyes girl

Rack 'em up stretch 'em out
When they're tight
This acetylene torch is giving me sight
War cries girl

Freeze on the radio
I've got to leave and more
Freeze on the radio
I've got to bleed into snow
Hold on
Let go
We know

Black and blue from the hullabaloo
Do the caribou bite
When they look into you
And your eyes girl

Freeze on the radio
I've got to leave and more
Freeze on the radio
I've got to bleed into snow
Hold on
Let go
We know
