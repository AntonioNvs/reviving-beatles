           Tricky: 
She's so malicious and so delicious  
Superstitious super suspicious  
Wonder woman under woman  
Only woman lonely woman  
You just rewind and we'll just be fine  
We'll just be fine you just be mine  
You just rewind and we'll just be fine  
You just be mine y ou just be mine  

     John Frusciante: 
You show me everything  
You fill me everywhere  
Your preaching that you care  
Do you care  

I'll fix to fall through time  
I knew your weren't mine  
I'll shine right through the sky  
Floating I try and try  
Captured by what I lose  
That' when I forced the flew  
Being will never be  
Have her remembering me  
 
            Tricky: 
Tuck your hair behind you ears  
Your tears and your silly fears  
I'll be your teddy bear  
You chose the clothes I wear  
For you I suffer much pain  
Sharp glass migraine  
For you I'd lose my focus  
For you I'd swim a swarm of locusts  

       John Frusciante: 
You show me everything  
You fill me everywhere  
Your preaching that you care  
Do you care  

Everytime I am you  
I feel forever new  
Posing along the beat  
You feel like I me  
If I were myself right now  
I wish I never found  
I'm holding on so tight  
Feeling like not feeling right  

You show me everything  
You fill me everywhere  
Your preaching that you care  
Do you care  

       Tricky: 
Here I remain  
She don't know my name  
Would she love me  
If I had real fame  
I feel bad pain  
Here come that rain  
I don't complain  
She's too complex  
Tell me your name  
Is that your real sex
