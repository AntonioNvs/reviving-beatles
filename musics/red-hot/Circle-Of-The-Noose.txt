Circle Of The Noose

Inspiration
Messed me up
Makes me cry
Come and see me please
Dragonfly, so I don’t die
Inner circle, break my heart so I can stop

All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
I don’t need it
Don’t need it
I don’t need it

Locomotives
Shoot me up
Shoot me down
Devastation boy
Deal me out
Steal my joy
Good for nothing
That’s the one, my mother’s song

All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
I don’t need it
Don’t need it
‘Neath the salt and the sea
Like for fun, yeah for free

Dogs are laughing
Laughing now that I know how
Human human form
I’m so warm inside this stone

All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
All I need is for bone and for free
All I need, all I need
I don’t need it
Don’t need it
I don’t need it
