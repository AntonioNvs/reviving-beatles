Knock Me Down

Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
