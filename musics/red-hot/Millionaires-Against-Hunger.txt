Millionaires Against Hunger

We're millionaires against hunger

I'm a millionaire and i got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as i'm concerned, why that's okay

Well i'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as i'm concerned, i got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, i've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, i've got to say
You and i, we're millionaires
But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts
And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize
There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide
We've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives

We're millionaires against hunger

Hey hey mr. millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
A spiritual price do you care?
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare

I'm a millionaire and i got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as i'm concerned, why that's okay

Well i'm a millionaire too all i know that is true
Is that i've got more cash than i can use
I want anything that i can have
But i don't need nothin' and i never have
Each damn day my heart's set far
But i'll be okay, 'cause i don't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion
So damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare
At the city at night, you know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires
Every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and i will now concern
To the type of problem that helps us learn

We're millionaires against hunger

Hey hey mr. millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey mr. millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare
