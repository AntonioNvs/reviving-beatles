Tellin' A Lie

Would you believe that I’m tellin' a lie?
Would you believe that it’s just a disguise?
I don’t invent myself to shelter cause the fame won’t kill me
The shame the game the lame
Broken rapture

You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime

Would you believe?
I would convince myself to hide but not to be with someone else
You crazy bastard
Would you believe that I’m tellin’ a lie?
Would you believe what you see in my eye?

You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime

Would you believe that I’m tellin’ a lie?
Would you believe that I cut you out?
I couldn’t tear myself of hatred from the loaded masses
It’s all it’s all a game, your crazy bastard

You might not be so down
If you knew my frown
You might not come around
Come over anytime
