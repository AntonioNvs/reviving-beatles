Hey

Won't somebody come along
And teach me how to keep it alive
To survive

Come along and show me something
That I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet

I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it, when I know

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today

I don’t want to have to but I will
If that’s what I am supposed to do
We don’t wanna set up for the kill
But that’s what I am about to do

Later on I’ll cut you off
When you’re screaming into the phone
Hard to own

Anyway I want to let you know
That everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me

You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you’re quick to get into your regret
Take a fall and now you got to give it all away

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today

I don’t want to have to but I will
If that’s what I am supposed to do
We don’t wanna set up for the kill
But that’s what I am about to do

I don’t want to have to but I will
If that’s what I am supposed to do
We don’t wanna set up for the kill
But that’s what I am about to do

Hey, what would you say if I stay
Stay for a while if I may
Say it again and I’ll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I change
Change everything but my name
Play it again and I’ll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time

You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret
But now I walk alone and talk about it, when I know

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today

Hey awe yeah how long
I guess I oughta walk away
Hey awe yeah so long
Whatcha gonna do today.
