Get On Top

Get on Top, get on top

Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me

Go-rilla Cunt-illa
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill, but I'm iller

I'll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I'll knock and
Set you up to get on top

Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on

Get up and come sit up, I light up but she lit it

Grass Hopper Show Stopper
The life of a Wife Swapper
Come with me 'cause I'm a big bopper
You do but I wopper

Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws

Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on

Get on top, get on top

Hit me, come get me, I bite but she bit me

Speed Baller Rhodes Scholar
Bottom Bitch and a Bottom Dollar
come with me 'cause I'm a free faller
you hoot but I holler

I'll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I'll knock and
Set you up to get on top

Get on top
Get on top
Get on top
