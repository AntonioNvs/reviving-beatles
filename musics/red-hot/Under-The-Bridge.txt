Under The Bridge

Sometimes I feel like
I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like
My only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets, 'cause
She's my companion
I walk through her hills, 'cause
She knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and
She kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

It's hard to believe that
There's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away
