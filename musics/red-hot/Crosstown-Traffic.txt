Crosstown Traffic

You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time, that a
Ninety mi-les an hour girl is the
Speed I drive

You tell me it's al-right
You don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to
Take you for a drive

You're just like

(Crosstown traffic) so hard to
Get through to you
(Crosstown traffic) I don't need to
Run over you
(Crosstown traffic) all you do is slow me down and I'm
Trying to get to the other side of town

I'm not the only soul who's
Accused of hit and run
Tyre tracks all across your back I can (heh)
I can see you had your fun

But ah, darlin' can't you see my
Signals turn from green to red
And with you I see a traffic jam
Straight up ahead

(Crosstown traffic) so hard to
Get through to you
(Crosstown traffic) I don't need to
Run over you
(Crosstown traffic) all you do is slow me down and I'm
Trying to get to the other side of town

(Crosstown traffic) so hard to
Get through to you
(Crosstown traffic) I don't need to
Run over you
(Crosstown traffic) all you do is slow me down and I'm
Trying to get to the other side of town
