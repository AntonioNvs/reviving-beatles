Little Miss Lover

Little miss lover, 
Where have you been in this world for so long 
Well, I love a lover that feels like you 
Would you like to tag along? 

Well I really don't need any help little girl 
But I think you could help me out anyway 

Would you believe babe I've been looking for a sole 
That feels like you 
For some time 
Excuse me while I see 
If the gypsy in me is right 
If you don't mind 

Well he signals me ok 
So i think it's safe to say 
I'm gonna make a play 
Oh yeah 

See me walk towards you baby 
Ah give me some 
Oh get into it 

Hey, hey little miss lover 
Well now, there's so much you and me can discover 
And i think we should start, hey, we should start right now, baby
