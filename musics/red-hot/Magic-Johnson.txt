Magic Johnson

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact
A claim that remains intact

M-A-G-I-C, see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C, magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams, but he doesn't give a fuck

Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck

Scott stops, pops and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named A.C. Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen

Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact
A claim that remains intact

M-A-G-I-C, see you in purple and gold
You can swim, but you won't get far, so you might as well go home
M-A-G-I-C, in buck we trust
Restoring order to the court and justice is a must

Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
Because they've got more moves than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum that deafens my ears

The one and only know
Of his kind sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
All time great super super star
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble

Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?
Does anybody want some Magic Johnson?

L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact
A claim that remains intact
