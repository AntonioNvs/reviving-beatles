Feels So Good

Well everybodys got an opinion thats loud and unbending
I spend my time healing and mending, together
Its a question of whether live positive well i give
P-Nut joins our back, must be arthritic
Tim is from the '70's and so we live it
SA has the wisdom of a nobel laureate
I'm down for our days of glory
It's easy to do when you're up with Sexton
A rhythmatic genius, turnin' up the next one
Would you know, you're a bro, I flow in that circumstance
You'll get your chance

Becuase payback is a motherfuckin' mission
To the sharp-ass rocks slippin' on us but we rock
It comes to writing on us derision
Sendin you a voice now we're sending you a vision

And those who fought me they say they taught me everything Iknow
I go aww, when I hear that, that chit and that caht, bullshit!
So sick of me knowing everything, saying!

In your face
That's right
And it feels so good
In your face
Yeah
It feels so good

Take it to 'em bro, throw down, now say
Settin' forth a course I'm really wiggin' out
In my dome I roam, no time to doubt
Fucked up you right there while I was rhymin'
Now you're sulking in the corner, a baby crying
Hittin' up now we feelin' to rock Mars
Fuckin' up the shit, now their heads bob
We ain't new to jack swing, the groove and that
We got crazy factiffs and we all that
I don't often rock and I'm a laureate
I don't pull the punch you know I'm throwin' it
Freestyles my style on the mic and flex
You're stalkin' the mind of a punk that's next

I get retarted now that I started you know
A condition which I keep close together
Like the kind buds you know my scene
My team thinks I sing supreme, but you, the weasel,
Try to bring us down but in reality it make you look like aclown
Too bad cause we'll be sittin' in the sun and choose a rocky assfast ball

In your face
That's right
And it feels so good
Choose a lock y'all
In your face
Yeah
It feels so good

Yo P-Nut, beat that thing

Won't you warm the mic Nicholas
Can't get with this my stream of conscieceness is a sea
Much like Bukowski with a rage
Speakin' to page
Beasts in the cage
Jumpin' off the stage
Divin'
Thrivin'
Strivin' for a better day or say
(Strive for a better day SA?)
Beat back by flesh
Shatterd doors braggin' fists to the sky we're feelin' high
Has to live and die

Just take a moment to have a fit once in a while
You know, you know
I do it daily and like it but that's my style, yeah, here I go

In your face
And dow your throat
And it feels so good
'fraid so
Fuck it up y'all
In you face
And down your throat
It feels so good
That's all
