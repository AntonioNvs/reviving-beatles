Midnight

Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one

Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they`re cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well, we go

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story

The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpio's at nine
Like the fear that's in eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know

Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well, we go

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story

Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Into the shadow show and

Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the loaded kids
All better take note of this
For the story

And everyone knows, anything goes
And now we are the Lotus kids
All better take note of this
For the story
