Hard To Concentrate

Hustle, bustle, and, so much muscle
Cells about to separate
Now I find it hard to concentrate
And, temporary this
Cash and carry 'em
Stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate

And, all I want is for you to be happy
And, take this moment to make you my family
And, finally you have found something perfect
And, finally you have found

Death defying this
Mess I'm buying its
Raining down with love and hate
Now, I find it hard to motivate

And, estuary is, blessed but scary
Heart's about to palpitate
Now, I'm not about to hesitate
And, want to treasure the rest of your days here
And, give you pleasure in so many ways dear

And, finally you have found something perfect
And, finally you have found
(Here we go)

Do you want me to show up for duty?
And, serve this woman, and honor her beauty

And, finally you have found something perfect
And, finally you have found

Yourself, with me, will
You, agree to take this man
Into your world
And now, we are as one

My lone ranger
The, heat-exchanger
Is, living in this figure eight
Now I do my best to recreate
And, sweet precision
And, soft collision
Heart's about to palpitate
Now I find it hard to separate

And, all I want is for you to be happy
And, take this woman and make you my family
And, finally you have found someone perfect
And, finally you have found

All I want is for you to be happy
And, take this woman and make you my family
And, finally you have found someone perfect
And, finally you have found

Yourself
