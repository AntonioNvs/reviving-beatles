Rivers Of Avalon

Deep inside these sleeping shallows,
Far away where no-one goes now,
Take my place in golden space
Of TV stars that no-one knows now,
Deep, deep mystery is talkin' to me,
She's the giver of constant animation,
All around and ready to make a new formation,
You're the reason I'm in this world...

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
Part of my scenery,
What I belong to is your ecstasy,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your faith unwavering is key,

The clone of my own loneliness
Has got to fade, what am I known to?
Little garland in your starling,
Loving waves that I've succumbed to,
Deep, deep mystery is talkin' to me,
She's the giver of constant adulation,
All around and ready to make a new formation,
You're the reason I'm this world...

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
Part of my scenery,
What I belong to is your ecstasy,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your faith unwavering is key,
What do you see in me?

Deep, deep mystery is talkin' to me,
She's the giver of constant animation,
All around and ready to make a new formation,
You're the reason I'm in this world...

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
Part of my scenery,
What I belong to is your ecstasy,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your faith unwavering is key,

I don't believe in everything I see,
Rivers of Avalon,
Your supernatural energy,
All that it means...
