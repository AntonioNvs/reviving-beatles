Cereal Song

Intro:

Well heroin, heroin
And cocaine, cocaine
I loved them both

But they took my life, they took my friends
They won't give 'em back, well I want 'em back
Give 'em back now

And what has it gotten me
Just some teeth I can't chew
My favorite cereal with

Being cool
And looking good
Keith Richards and Lenny Bruce
And all of them
Well I give up

Sometimes
I'll get sad
Or I'll get mad
About where I should be
And where I am
I wanna go back

But where has it gotten me
I'm 35 years old now
I wash dishes in a restaurant

Well my friend Robert
He can't stop
And his teeth are falling out
And he's living at his mom's
And it's no fun
No

I guess I'm lucky to be alive
Yeah I'm lucky I'm alive
'Cause I should be dead
Well I have been dead
But I'm not now
No

And what has it got me
Just some teeth I can't chew
My favorite cereal with

Where has it gotten me
I'm 35 years old now
Work in a fucking restaurant

Well heroin
Heroin
And cocaine
Cocaine
I loved them both
