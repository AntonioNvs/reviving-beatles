Parallel Universe

Deep inside of a parallel
Universe
It's getting harder and harder
To tell what came first

Under water where thoughts can breathe
Easily
Far away you were made in a sea
Just like me

Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything

Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my
A solar system that fits in your eye
Microcosm

You could die but you're never dead
Spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head
Fields of space, kid

Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything

Psychic changes are born in your heart
Entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart, girl

Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty Cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you

Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh
It's everything
