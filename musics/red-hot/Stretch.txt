Stretch

Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favour of this motion

Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your hole

When it rains, I let myself get wet
I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother

Proposing to expose your head
Just something that is like no other

Hit it

I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out my friend
I'll stretch you out

The juice that flows from intuition is my liquid fare
We are all in favor of the open end
Three pounds of love and knowledge are expanding in my skull

Truth be told, we let the good times roll

I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And its making and creating love

Tender titillations

I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out my friend
I'll stretch you out

I'm a fish and I can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong

Ow

There's a glowing up around the Moon it's showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing
Very legendary instraplanetary fairy

Varied truths
She's making just for you

Yes, I have always wanted to
Give something to this stranger

M-M-M-Moving to approve the groove
A mental transformation
