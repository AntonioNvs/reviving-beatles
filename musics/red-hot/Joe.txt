Joe

Burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch
Burn it up, no need to reconcile
Come and see me, i'm your west end perfect stranger, in america
Lady on that state's so full of style

Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe

The many boots that you have laced could tell a story, comin night and day (?)
No one said that you would need a crowd
The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
And now i only see your face in clouds

Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe
Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe

Tell me so (?)
Do you know
Does it show
When i'm low

And then again, when i feel your love from far away, i think of yesterday
I see a family we know how to smile
There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along
There comes a time when we will walk that mile

Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe
Stand up, turn around, beat it out you gotta sound, joe
Swing low and now i know, its hard to let a brother go, joe
