Time

Time

I was walking 
through a courtyard
without shoes and 
without regard 
automatic catacombs
take me where I wanna go 

All around 
all in faces 
it astounds 
and amazes 
good to last innatural 
touch me I'm a chromosome 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time 
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
time 

Ultra-fine and ultralistic 
can I spy into the mystic 
system down for infiltration 
open mind free of frustration 

I was driving 
to a safe place 
and arriving
as I retraced 

Yell into a telescope 
aim it at the star of hope 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
time 

All over the under 
the smell of blood and thunder 
I'm connected by the lightning rod
giving into the beauty and 
heaven knows how well I know you 

Ultra-fine and ultralistic 
can I spy into the mystic 
system down for infiltration 
open mind free of frustration 

All around 
all in faces 
it astounds 
and amazes 
good to last innatural 
touch me I'm a chromosome 

What time 
Fascinated by the face of time
What time 
I got it to give and now we're gonna make some 
time 

All over the under 
the smell of blood and thunder 
I'm connected by the lightning rod 
giving into the beauty too and 
heaven knows how well I know you 

Time. . .
