Blood Sugar Sex Magik

Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish?
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity, my affinity
I mingle with the gods, I mingle with devinity

Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimensions to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snowwhite throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice, a fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower, she must be moist
