Save This Lady

I Got More Love Than Anything Else 
But A Jezebelle Spirit Gonna Steal My Health 
Struck By The Notion That It Just Might Be 
A Method To The Madness That I Cannot See 

Something For The Freedom Of A Roughed-Up Soul 
For The Two Years Young Is A Little Bit Old 
Born Named Sue Sing A Tennassee Tune 
Got Buffalo Love Living On The Moon 

[Chorus] 
Save This Lady For Me [x4] 

Call Me Alabama I'm A Seminole Prize 
Got Time Square Hair And A Bedroom Eyes 
Keystone Cops And The Billy Bob Chops 
Gonna Scare My Kids Gonna Share My Crops 

Vampire Blood And A Baseball Love 
Justa A Little Bit Of What The Girl Is Made Of 
National Crash Into The Big Lampoon 
With A Creature Coming Up From The Black Lagoon 

[Chorus] 

Losing Ground True Sounds Of Liberty 
The Forest Of The North Might Hold The Key 

Rocking To The Rythm Of A Ragtime Band 
Black Flag Wave On On My Truck My Man 
Blasting For Jones And The Great Unknowns 
Got Cheap Cologne Seventy-Six Trombones 

Looking For The Lady That Won't Be Afraid 
When Heaven Needs A Hammer Gotta Get Things Made 
I Got More Love Than Anything Else 
But A Jezebelle Spirit Gonna Steal My Health
