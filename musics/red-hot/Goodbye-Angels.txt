Goodbye Angels

Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my girl

In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time

Overkill, you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light

Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, big fight

Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young

Say goodbye, my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, this life

Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, find you

Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo, wonder

Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, story

Say goodbye, my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Babe, I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick, it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my bat

Suicide is never gonna save you
When I cried, it was because I came to
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, kiss this
