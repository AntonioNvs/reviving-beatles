Magpies On Fire

Magpgies on fire
Making love like little
Worms out on the porch can
Leave the medicine
Oh well I'm game
For anything at all

Scarecrows a liar
Spends the year alone
No one checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon
And now it's time to fall

All in all it's like the
Bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
Love

What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

All in all it's just
A call of something wise beyond your room
There's a changing of a major chord
Your minor threat will do, love

My gun misfired
Shot myself instead I guess
I always knew I'd be the one to lose
Last scream don't slane
Time to make a move

What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

All in all it's like the
Bird who's trapped alone inside the cage
Love
A bird who's going to live at half your age, girl
A bird who's never really here to say

What more do you want?
How much more can you take?
I love my mistakes
I've been here before

Least of all she's like
A bird who's now been
Freed from someone's cage
