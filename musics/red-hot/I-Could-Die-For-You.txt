I Could Die For You

Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't wanna live somebody else's life
This is what I wanna be
And this is what I give to you, because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time

I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose

I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really wanna do is turn into the motion beauty that I can abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it on and then
I'd find a way to share
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

Come again and tell me where you wanna go
What it means to me to be with you alone?
Close the door and no one has to know how we are
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

Make me wanna say

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
