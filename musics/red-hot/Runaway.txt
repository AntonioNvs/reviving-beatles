Runaway

Walking around, I love a town 
Walking it out, when you want to 
Soldiering my styling smiling 
Journey in do wherever I choosen 
Take me now to the water 

Don't be late I hear it 
Gonna get so very great and, 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway 
All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 

Kick it around, stare at the ground 
Break it down, when you want to 
Soldiering my days I chose on 
Dance around do wherever I want to 
Take me now, it's the water 

Don't be late I hear it 
Gonna get so very great and, 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway 
All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 

I think I know 
Everything you gonna say 
I think you know 
I wanna runaway 

Don't be late I hear it 
Gonna get so very great and, 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway 
All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 

All the reason that I count of you can on the way, and 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 
More and more I'm walking like a runaway 
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway
