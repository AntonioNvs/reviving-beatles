Dark Necessities

Coming on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play, so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?

Spinning knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light and a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say
Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design, and
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand
Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time?
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac, so I
Move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll
Everything must go away
Oh, what do you say?
Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
