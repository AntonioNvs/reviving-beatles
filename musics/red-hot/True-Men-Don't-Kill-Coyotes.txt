True Men Don't Kill Coyotes

Well, I'm gonna ride a Sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood Hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yea that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt and I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Riding wild on a Paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood Hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood Hills

Well, I'm gonna ride a Sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood Hills
Just don't show me anything
'Cause that's the way I feel
Well I dig the dirt and I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Riding wild on a Paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood Hills, yea
Huh, Hollywood Hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
And blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't kill coyotes

Well, I'm gonna ride a Sabertooth horse
