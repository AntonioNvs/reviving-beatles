Police Station

Saw you at the police station
And it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes had wandered off
To something distant
Cold and grey
I guess you didn’t see it coming
Someone’s gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away
But we both know it’s somewhere

I saw you on the back page
Of some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes
Said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers
Not today
I send a message to her
A message that I’m coming
Coming to pursue her

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I’ve got you 10 times over
I’ll chase you down
Till you’re dead

I saw you on a TV station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper
Smiling was your money maker
Someone ought to situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way
Time to come and find you
You can’t hide from me girl
So never mind what I do

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I’ve got you 10 times over
I’ll chase you down
Till you’re dead
I met my soul mate country
And I left it all for your head

I saw you in the church yard
There was no time to exchange
You were getting married
And it felt so very strange
I guess I didn’t see it coming
Now I guess it’s me who’s bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get used to
So now I will refuse to

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soul mate country
And I left it all for your head
I’ve got my best foot forward
And I chase you down till you’re dead
