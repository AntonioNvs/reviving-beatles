My Boy, My Girl

My boys, they like to tell me when I'm wrong [hey now]
My girl, she like to sing now sing my song
Everybody tell me when I'm wrong [today]
Anyway, I say
My boys (hey), they like to tell me when I'm bad [c'mon]
Make me happy when I'm sad [c'mon now]
Take it Johnny!

I said my girl, she like to say "that's what I had"
When I'm here, now when I'm wrong, and when I'm bad
Anyway, I'd like to say "oh yeah"
C'mon Chad!

My boy, he like to tell me what I had
Yeah now, what dyou do with everything you've had?
I don't know, that ain't bad
Woo, no, that ain't bad
