Over Funk

Press start dirty 
It's 7:30 
Loss of might and 
Cat alertly
My best, your rest 
Send your call 
And then I nest 

Perversity in features 
Adversity the teachers 
Some call love more 

Soon I'll call the rhythm song 

It's over 
It's over now 
So long to doo-doo-ra 
It's over 
It's over now 
I dare not get a look 

Be yourself 
Some let her call 
Never fall 
See yourself 
Sit alone and wait 
To my own call 

Go ballistic 
Anarchistic 
Smack my mouth and 
Then you kissed it 
So long, my gun 
Simple run and 
Letter bum 

Things are looking good on paper 
Once when I was in your favour 
This kiss is a mess 
Send my girl riddle less 

It's over 
It's over now 
So long to riddle songs 
It's over 
It's over now 
I dare not read a song 

See yourself 
Sad, alone and wait 
To my own brawl 
Free yourself 
There's an only count 
This stands for all of them 

Just play at any tempo 
Going mad and going mental 
All balm, said no 

Just to let him put it wrong 

It's over 
It's over now 
So nice to get along 
It's over 
It's over now 
It's over 
It's over now
