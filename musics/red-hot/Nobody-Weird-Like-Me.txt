Nobody Weird Like Me

The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Living my life in and out of the twilight zone

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Intercourse with a porpoise is a dream for me
Hell bent on inventing a new species

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Riding down the path on the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed, 'cause I passed some gas

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Enchanted as a rabbit that my life is a dream
Well, everything is never, just as it seems

The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Living my life in and out of the twilight zone
