Never Gone Away

you've never gone away from my head
you've never gone away from my heart
(i tried to hide from you
i tried to keep myself alone)all the letters i sent you
you'll read again tonighti even thought i was wrong
cause you didn't receive with love
those letters i wrote to you
when i still love you
