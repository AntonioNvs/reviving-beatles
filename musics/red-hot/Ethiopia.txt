Ethiopia

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
When you give your love away
You get a feeling for

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Live to love another day
Even when you feel unsure

More and more I wanna raise
Raise my bar
And raise your stakes

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
When I lay there wide awake
For my son I’ll make

Tell my boy
I love him so
Tell him
So he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
We walk out in that road

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Somethin’ good gonna come your way
Just look out your door

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Tell 'em what you want to say
No matter what you might incur

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
Steal my heart to give away
Make me want to say

E     I     O     I     E     I     A
You and I are sewn the same
More and more and more
Each day
