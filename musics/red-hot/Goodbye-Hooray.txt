Goodbye Hooray

Junior pimp at the old café
Got to chase those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound

Hustlers get what they deserve
But it’s always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

See you around I’ll see you around
I’ll play all night
Can’t get uptight
I’ll lead all your mind games astray
See you around I’ll see you around
I’ll play all night
Can’t get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray!

Curb your tongue oh scallywag
Because you’ve got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day
