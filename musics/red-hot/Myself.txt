Myself

Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still havent had my fulfill

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?

Broken heart and broken bones
Think of how a castrated horsefeels
One more quirky cliche'd phrase
You're the one i wanna refill

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?

Most people don't realize
That two large pieces of coral,
Painted brown, and attached tohis skull
With common wood screws can makea child look like a deer

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?

Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still havent had my fulfill

In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
