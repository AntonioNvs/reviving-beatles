This Is The Kitt

This is the kitt, I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute I do declare
Let's sing a new revival

Chemical circus at the pub
Mentally she's departed
Cut me a check I'll cut your rug
Later we'll get bombarded

'Cause everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is the always red
In your wedding bed
Oh, everybody knows

Officer please I just got there
Travelled from door to door
Haven't you seen my girlfriend's hair
What are we looking for

And everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows
The day is full of highs and lows
Is the always red
In your wedding bed
Oh, everybody knows

Talk to me

This is the kitt I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute I do declare
I think we have our bible

Everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is the always red
In your wedding bed

Take me to the shore
Show me what it's for
Is there always red
In your wedding bed?

Everybody knows
This game is full of cons and pros
Like your mother said
"Girl, your father's dead"
Everybody knows
