Girls

Tricky: 
         Girls, Boys  

Girls wish you never had boys  
They grow up to be bad boys  
Cry I've never had boys  
Never seen your dad boy  
I've never seen my dad boy  
Without the Roy  
And when my career stops kicking  
I'm gonna stick him  

          Anthony Kiedis: 
Rock-a-dub now let me show you where it's at boy  
Just a puppet and you grew into a fat boy  
Make a dog and you chase another cat boy  
Blow it up and let me show you where its at boy

           Anthony Kiedis: 
Staring through the sun tell your devil beware  
I am not the son of your family affair  
Baby breaks away and I've got my face in my hand  
Genetics from my gun, trust me I don't care  

           Tricky: 
I don't need no man  
Little boys  
 
          Anthony Kiedis: 
Rappa rouser, bappa bouser  
Shake it for me baby let me step into your trousers  
I allow this  
Come on baby let me take to the houses  
I allow this  
This is now and you better bow this  
This is now and you better bow this  
This is now and you better bo w this  

    Anthony Kiedis &amp; Tricky: 
Staring through the sun tell your devil beware (jamaica's skirts and blouses)  
I am not the son of your family affair (he didn't rob his houses)  
Baby breaks away and I've got my face in my hand (fuck the biological)  
Genetics from my gun, trust me I don't care  

              Tricky: 
I don't need no man  
Little boys 
Tricky: 
I'm not a fire starter  
Cause I'm a little smarter  
Smarter than the average bear  
I don't care family's there  

          Anthony Kiedis: 
Rock-a-dub now let me show you where it's at boy  
Just a puppet and you grew into a fat boy  
Make a dog and you chase another cat boy  
Blow it up and let me show you where it's at boy
