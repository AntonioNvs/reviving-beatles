One Big Mob

I am you are me, I am you are me
I am you are me, I am you are me
(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Good woman said, "You gotta believe"

(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Submerge into the urge of we
(I am you are me, I am you are me, I am you are me)
Deliciously, the mystery, the mystery

One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob is

Ooze into into my noodle, east or west shepherd or poodle
Lady bug, pine tree to mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun and a brother to the cool breeze
One big mob is

One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob is

We live in the city, we live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking a thimble humble
Everything you ever see is never more than you and me
Give it on into the beauty of the mystery
One big mob is all

One big mob in one big home, a broken home
I'd like to share some air with you, some air with you
A morning forest full of truths, the green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives to give and give

What was I thinking in my head? The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread, something I said
Checkmated by frustration, I need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost, a sullen cost

I am you are me, I am you are me
I am you are me, I am you are me
(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Good woman said, "You gotta believe"

(I am you are me, I am you are me)
Submerge into the urge of we
(I am you are me, I am you are me, I am you are me)
Deliciously, the mystery, the mystery

One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Eh bara mala, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
One big mob is

Scrawled upon the wall of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note that spoke to all
One, two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me 'cause I might be you
One big mob is

One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
Eh bara mala, oh yeah, oh yeah
One big mob is

Picaboo street in Timbuktu
Do I need to repeat that a boy named Sue?
Rockin' to the beat of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet and forehead too
One big mob is
