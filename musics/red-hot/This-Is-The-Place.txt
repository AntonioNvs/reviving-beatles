This Is The Place

This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything is slow
Can I get some vaseline?
Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you

This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene?
Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it but I gotta know

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you

I saw you out there yesterday
What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you wanna say?
A masterpiece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean
I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake it but I gotta know

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking appalling
All I can do to you

I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray
A mash of DNA
Another poppin' Jay who thinks he's got something to say
