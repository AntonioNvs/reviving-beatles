Readymade

Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

I've gotta cousin making beats deep down in arizona
We're gonna rocket to ramone's in the city of pomona

Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

And I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it

Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

I've gotta sister makin' babies with a black and decker blow torch
We're gonna top it all the night in the middle of a back porch

Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

And I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it

Aw, clean it up, Johnny!

Readymade, readymade
Rock it for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen, but don't be afraid

I've gotta brother makin' trouble in the state of caledonia
I wish I knew another way, but I'm gonna have to clone, ya

Readymade, readymade
Rock it for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid

And I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it
