Baby Appeal

On the city streets I got the tunes in my pocket
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister won't you hear my thoughts
I play in a band yea we're called the Red Hots
Out of my way boy I'm afraid not
I've got no time to think and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin' that itty bitty tot
Her pop said no but she just couldn't stop
The kid had a case of toddler rock

Well here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, yea it makes them squeal
The Chili Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk-o-meal
I'm overjoyed we have baby appeal

We stoke the fire we crank the heat
4 groove dog brothers funkin’ out in the street
Rockin’ up a storm when who do we meet
But the hop, skip, jump, bumpin’ baby de beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know she called out her fleet
5000 babies rockin’ out in the street
That's a serious sight I mean golly, gee whiz
I just can't tell you how much we dig
Rock out for those itty, bitty kids

Well here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, yea make them squeal
The Chili Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we reel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk-o-meal
I'm overjoyed we have baby appeal, so get down

Got the tunes in my box...
Baby appeal...
Rock out…
Play the Chili, play the Chili, play the Chili...
Yes we're called the Red...Hots...
