Nevermind

Yo in the middle of June in the summer of '59
I was young and cool, shot a bad game of pool, and I hustled all the chumps I could find. Now they call me the swan cause I wave my magic wand and I loved all the women to death. I partied hard, packed a mean rod, and I'll knock you out with a right or left.

That jive's just one big flub
Cause we're
The Red Hot Chili Peppers
