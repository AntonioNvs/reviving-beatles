Dance, Dance, Dance

You got yours and I’ve got mine
She got his and she got shine
Under moon and overseas
She got those and we got these

Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long and all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong we got strong
Let’s say hello
It’s safe to go

Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long and all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong we got strong
The light is right
Let’s play tonight
Let’s play

Give yourself a chance
To find a way
The holiness of play
Is here to stay

They got this and we got that
He got his and she got fat
You got mine and I got yours
I’ve got love but you’ve got more

Give yourself a chance
To find a way
The holiness of play
Is here to stay

Tell your mom and dad, it’s all ok
The holiness of play is here to stay

You got yours and I’ve got mine
He got his and she got shine
We got all and she got high
Some got hot and they got by

Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long and all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong we got strong
The light is right
Let’s play tonight
Let’s make the rise
The sun
The prize
Let’s play
Let’s play
