Around The World

All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya'
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya'
'Bout the motha' fuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said: Hallelujah
Good God, girl! I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello, and then I say: I do

Come back baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride, step aside my Johnson
Yes I could in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say: I do

Where you want to go, who you want to be
What you want to do, just come with me
I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me girl, sitting in the Swiss mountains
Me, oh, My O, Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rocking Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife, 'cause life is beautiful

I know I know for sure
Ding deng dong dong ding deng dong dong ding deng
I know I know it´s you
Ding deng dong dong ding deng dong dong ding deng

Mother Russia do not suffer, I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say: I do
