Sunday, Bloody Sunday

I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away

How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
Tonight we can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
And bodies strewn across a dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost but tell me who has won?
The trenches dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV is reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

I wipe the tears from your eyes
I wipe your tears away
I wipe your tears away
I wipe your tears away
I wipe your bloodshot eyes

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
