We Believe

The curtain
Is open
A head to
Put dope in
Now we will
Come clean it
The future
We've seen it
No, no, I know, I said, no, no

It's like a dream
That falls away
Into the night
Where we can play
I'm on a train
One happy day
Two eyes for sight
Three times I pray

Soda pop
We've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes
We've got a pressure drop
We don't know
But everyday I go
To see what I can bring
Into a cameo
Oh oh oh no

We believe
We believe
We believe (climb a tree for monkey business, write a check out to forgivness)
We believe (all the world on half an Acre, pushing dirt into a quaker)

The mission
The method
The downfall
Arrested
'Cuz it's not
The first time
Nor is it
The worst time
No no oh no

To see the bird
Without a care
For in a word
It's nice out there
In a tree
My mama bear
Will be all right
With proper care

Hey hey hey do

Boomerang
Into a bigger bang
A little cry of love
Because they cannot sing
Cherokee
What did the pharaoh see
Another time and space
Another place to be

We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe
We believe (climb a tree for monkey business, write a check out to forgivness)
We believe (all the world on half an Acre, pushing dirt into a quaker)
We believe (climb a tree for monkey business, write a check out to forgivness)
We believe (all the world on half an Acre, pushing dirt into a quaker)

The motive
The measure
The purpose
The pleasure

The risk is
It worth it
The disc is
It perfect

I found you
Amongst them
The flower
With young stem

Disparage
The broken
The marriage
Alopin'
