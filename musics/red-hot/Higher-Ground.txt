Gonna keep on tryin' till I reach the highest ground

(And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's gonna bring me down)
Till I reach the highest ground
('Cause me 'n' Stevie, see, we're gonna be a sailin' on the funkysound)
Till I reach the highest ground
(Bustin' out, and I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailin' on)
Till I reach the highest ground
(Just, uh, sailin' on, sailin' on the higher ground)
Till I reach the highest ground
