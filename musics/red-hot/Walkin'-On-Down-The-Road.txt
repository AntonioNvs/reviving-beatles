Walkin' On Down The Road

Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'Cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
I'm walkin' on down the road

Groovin' a tune straight out of the womb
'Cause trust is a must to be a true blue dude
That's a matter of fact don't be confused
Everybody knows true friends are few

Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody thinks, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'Cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
And I'm walkin' on down the road

Like a momma bear hugs her baby bear cubs
A dude he can't lose when he lives on love
Like the bark on a tree
Like the skin on my knees
I'm standin' by my blood

Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody thinks, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody thinks, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song

Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'Cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
I'm walkin' on down the road
I'm walkin' on down the road
I'm walkin' on down the road
