Go Robot

I called the teacher 'cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow?
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from

I don't take these things so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore

Somebody hooted and they hollered: Can I buy a vowel?
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl?

I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

I wanna thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know, she looked like Alice Cooper

I don't think that it's so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

I wanna thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

I'm kissing high and low, our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret

I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore

Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

I wanna thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
