Stadium Arcadium

Bells around St. Petersburg
When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find

Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushin' a broom out into a space
And this where I find a way

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself and no
I don't mind asking now

Alone inside my forest room
And it's stormin'
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start

Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling

Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
The state of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself and no
I don't mind asking now

And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
The state of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself and no
I don't mind asking

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming
To you
