Get Up And Jump

Get up and jump, get up and jump
Get up, get up, get up and jump
Jump on up, jump on down
Just jumpa, jumpa, jumpa, jumpa
Jump around, jump the day away
Jump all over town
‘Cause jumpin’s okay in a jumpin’ kinda way
Hey hey

Jumpa boy, jump a girl
Jumpa rope, jump for joy
Just don’t stop jumpin’
Keep your heart muscle pumpin’
Hillel be jumpin’ on the little baby frumpkin
Say what you got a pumpkin in your pants

When you’re standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs getting a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
A don’t you know they’re jumpin’ foos
Jump you

Jump a nun, jump a jack
Jump for fun, jump back
A how’s about us jumpin’ the sack
Now it’s time for a jump attack

Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump

Jama Boba Jima Boba
Slima Boba boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Lookin’ like you’re might silly
Say what you got a pumpkin in your pants
You got a pumpkin
In your pants

Mr. Mexican jumping bean
Knows his fun is skeaky clean
Christ how’d you think he got so clean
Not from sittin’ on his goddamn spleen
Get up

Oh I be jumpin’, I be jumpin’
I be jumpin’ alone
I be jumpin’ for the phone
I be jumpin’ Mrs. Jones
I really wanna jump on Kinski’s bones

Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump

Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump

Jama Boba Jima Boba
Slima Boba boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Lookin’ like you’re might silly
Say what you got a pumpkin in your pants
You got a pumpkin
In your pants
