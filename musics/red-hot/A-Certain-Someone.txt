A Certain Someone

When it will come around
The wind that... will inspire

When will it make a sound
The sound... I desire

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something... that's true

Floating upstream I've seen
The spider and the snake
A trip without pause when
I saw... my mistake

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something... that's true

All my life... I have known who I am
A troubled man but I stand

All my life I have seen what it means
To be myself in this dream

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain someone... that's you
