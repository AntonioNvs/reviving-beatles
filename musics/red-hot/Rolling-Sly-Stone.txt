Rolling Sly Stone

I should be on my way
I really bought not stay
Far too strong with the pinnup on
Hear my conscience, "I'm gone!"

I should have let you know
This boy/ball was made to roam
The band is who I`m married to
And this is work I`ve set to do

I let my motor stray
Forgive me where I play
Sendin' my love to Tennessee
She got style now lets see

And remember, who
To surrender to
The captain of my ship is brave
It's brothers hood on a mothers day

Do do do dit do

Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

I'm off to wonderland
Just in my second hand
Life is short but it ain`t planned
I`m away outside but in demand

I'll take it on my chin
Go back and forth again
Find me on some telephone
With a broken down voice and a shake-ed tone

Do unto others who
You would have do to you
Ain`t no way I`d ever trade
That sparer life for this piece of shade

Destined for battle zone
Why's there no lesson known?
The lesson`s not to wait for me
Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet

Do do do dit do

Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

Bridge:
Let your jaw decide
Let your jaw divide
Everything we do

Let your motor ride
Let your motor ride
Everything we do

Oh! Help me!

Do do do dit do

Oh, sure enough I love you
Oh, sure enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

We could have made it our love
We could have skated through
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to
