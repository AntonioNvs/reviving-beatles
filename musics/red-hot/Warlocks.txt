Warlocks

Warlocks in wonderland
I’ve gotta megatropolis in my hand
And a... subterranean marching band
Makin’ noise for the boys in the Vatican
And a

A little package and off we go
Oh... ticky ticky tackita tic tac toe
I know... everybody’s Eskimo
We’ve got another thing coming
And that’s our show... well

Every night I go looking for you
Everyone in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it’s what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in

Lilacs and contraband
I’ve got Santa Monica in my hand
A little... Beatlemania when I can
And I’ve got two big bags of old Japan

Ring side and blow-by-blow
Another... main event at the old rainbow
Were comin’... Right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot

Make a deal with Uncle Weezer
Sign your name to claim
China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane

Warlocks in wonderland
I’ve gotta... Rockapotomus in my hand
With a….Happy ending that’s made of sand
With a little bit of lovin’ is all I can
