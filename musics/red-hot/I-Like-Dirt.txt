I Like Dirt

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream
Live in a dream

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream
In your spring
Live in a dream

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one

I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the women is on the one
