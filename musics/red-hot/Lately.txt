Lately

On the corner
Into my car
I drive forever
And never get far

The 45 is slowly getting loaded
Send another song to my star

California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up
Get it off
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Get it off
Take more than your

Woah woah
Woah woah

A pendulum inside of my head
Swinging low I hope to get hit
The overflow is slowly adding up
Another drop will never fix it

California mountains in the morning
Get along
Get it off
All along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Get it off
Take more than your
Faith

If I called you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I called you lately
I could be your man

Woah woah
Woah woah

Shut it down
Now look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead
A covered in flies

The big sleep
Without A bed of roses
A light of day
Will never tell lies

Fall along the woman's got a warning
Stitch it up
Get it off
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up
Get it off
We all walked your pavement
Take more than your faith

If I called you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I called you lately
I could be your man

On the river
Into my dock
I paddle through
The shadow and fog

To ponder all of those
That came before me
Another piece for
Building my arch
