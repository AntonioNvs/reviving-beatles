Strip My Mind

Arthur J did indicate
The boulevard would never be
So full of love and life again

Hot as Hades early eighties
Sing another song and make me
Feel like I’m in love again

Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

All in favor sign the waiver
Bloody Carolina won't you
Take another look inside

Operator, co-creator
Come on radiator won't you
Blow another top and sing

El Dorado won the lotto
All that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through
