The Sunset Sleeps

Floozies at the rainbow
Superstars that won't get far
Who is who that we know
Coochie coo is at the bar

Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you want to make the call
We all long, we all fall

Shoelace for the sirens
Groupies and the tyrants ply

Do you really want
Do you want do you want
Do you want to have it all
We all long, we all fall

I'm so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way

Suitcase of perception
Rhinestones and redemption cries

(Omitted from final song)
Feast your eyes on stardom
A sacred strip that never lies

Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you want to make the call
We all long, we all fall

I'm so tired
The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way

Do you really love
Do you love do you chase
Do you take this town today
We all long, we all face

(Added to final song)
I'm so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
And I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way

The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
A perfect world
with all its perfect places
I could use a few
For just in cases

And I'm so tired
That I slept
Along the way
