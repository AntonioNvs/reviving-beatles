The Hunter

Woke up this morning like I always do
I still like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay

Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me, I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay

Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me, I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray

Even though you raised me, I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy, you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea
