Quixoticelixer

Kick back and love it just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby but not yet sunk
How I listened low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold

Gravity free, is she, look at her
Highness on a mattress full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
Your smell or your go-to-hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it probably will not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how did I get
Your lipstick on my kite

I love this weather it's a perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keep me warm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form

Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Oh, lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind in a medicated state
Is a highly over-rated fate
Terrible, is it so what you told me
That there is such a thing?
Do you know that you glow when you go
From winter in the spring?

I love this weather it's a perfect storm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form
I love this weather 'cause it keep me warm
Just keep it coming in its perfect form

The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick get strong
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick get strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on fourth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick get

Kick back and love it just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby but not yet sunk
How I listened low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold

I swear to God I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you

I stand before this now, no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you

I swear to God I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to God I could not hurt you

I swear to God I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you

Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, oh
Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, oh
Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, oh
