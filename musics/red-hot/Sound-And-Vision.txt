Sound And Vision

SOUND AND VISION 


 
Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision ?

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live.
Blue, blue.

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue.

And I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sit
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision

Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision ?
