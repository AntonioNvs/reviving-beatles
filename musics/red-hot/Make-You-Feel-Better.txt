Make You Feel Better

She's the one she's the only one
She큦 got ripped back light
Gonna make me come
I say... when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

I say now I큞l take it
It's better for you
Somehow we큞l make it
Cause that큦 what we do.

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me
And that is why I

Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire
Jump up to meet.

I say now I큞l take it
It's better for you
Somehow we큞l make it
Cause that큦 what we do.

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
(Oh Yeah!)

In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck.

I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth
And a pack of style

I say... she큦 the one, she is the only one
Makes me search myself
Until I큟 done... and

Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars
Make a diagram... and

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better

Oh, yeah!
Hell, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
for the red on rust... I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said

I say now I큞l take it
It's better for you
Somehow we큞l make it
Cause that큦 what we do.

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better

We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
Now...
