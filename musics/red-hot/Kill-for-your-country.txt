Kill for your country

All over Shangai market
Put up the…
Holding wood…
All the way...

No one is quite so different
People who…
Understood…
EnemyÂ…

The King and Queen are sleeping
Industry…
Ecstasy….
Sympathy…

Sympathy….

I walk the road today
Across the valley and I won't stay
I will miss this
Land and this promise

I'm streaming next to you
I won't believe it, Is it really true??!!
When they say you should
Kill for your country
Kill for your country

I've got three kids to feed
Fine woman and a need to speak
Far away from this
Land and its promise

I want to walk to you
I need a peace that I wish I knew
Time to leave and go
Kill for my country
Aaahh… Kill for my country

Hold me down now, hold your fire
Not now folk that we inspire
Turn around and hold your fire

Shake 'em all off, make-belief
Control the line, just let me be
We're all just make-believe

Hold a child, met the man
Bring 'em all on to the grave
Barbershop and a close shave

Seen the goons, now, seen my chances
Running, from our enemy still
We are soldiers, we ain't dying yet!!...

Run 'em down, run Â'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire

This is my message to you
This is a tale of the tomb

Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire
Run 'em down, run 'em down
Hold your fire, hold your fire

Why can't we make it alone
Shake off the smooch on the phooooooone.
