Love Of Your Life

Sat on a cliff
Wondering what did I miss
I watch the waves come in
Roll in, roll out
Without a single doubt

Love on a bluff
Is there ever enough
I stare into the air
Somewhere out there
The family affair
Bring home the night

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

She gave me the love

Coming up short
And I’m sad to report
We fuss and fight tonight
Your case, my case
Another day to waste

Lovers don’t mix
When they can’t even fix
A plot that has a twist
To share, my prayer
I need my baby bear
Come home tonight

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Hey, I know that I waited so long
Hey, so slow but you gave me
The love of my life

Oh, she gave me the love of my life
Tell her Flea, go ahead
