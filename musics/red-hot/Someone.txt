Someone

Someone

There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for 

Nothing major or too complicated
Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated
For someone someone 

Cut my heart out 
With a feather
And put an end 
To any extra pressure 

For someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for 

Ride around on mellow waves of mercy
And fill the space with lack of controversy 

For someone
Someone 

Set it up to follow you
On my aeroplane
Here's a present
For the future memory lane 

Someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for 

Light it up the room
She sang into any twane
Hit 'em up cause you got me
A mop to your plane 

Someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for me 

For me 
For me
For me
