Eskimo

In the name of it's for you I
Bought it all and it's all on true I
Know, I'm a little slow desperate and it shows
In the name of spindestry,a burning bush and it busted me
Who stole all the rain and snow
Who will be my eskimo that's what I wanna know
It's time to under go, somewhere in Mexico
I'll make a room for you
A simple point of view, someone to deep the two
Searching for an eskimo, searching and I wanna know 
Someone like you, desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an eskimo, someone like you.
In the name of Jesus Christ I 
Sold my soon and I named my prize I
Soo, just a little low
Who will be my eskimo, that's what I wanna know
Before I under go, somewhere in Mexico
I'll make a room for you, a simple point of view
Someone to deep the two
Searching for an eskimo
Searching and I wanna know someone like you
Desperate and I gotta go, searching for an eskimo
Someone like you.
In the name of Oscar Wilde I
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I
Go, toe-to-toe with a hoe, well to find an eskimo.
