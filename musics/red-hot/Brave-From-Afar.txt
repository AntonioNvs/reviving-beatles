Brave From Afar

Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when they tell you
They sell you
For your children
The shelter they're building

Prime time the perfect crime
Bow my head the AX we grind
Ruse cruise p's and q's
I got beat up by the evening news

Deep hits the media blitz
Lost my mind to keep my witts
Maintain the same old same
Goodbye Shiz and so long game

Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when they tell you
They sell you
For your children
The shelter they're building

Plain Jane the big campaign
The last detail has been restrained
Fraud fraud the lightning rod
When you see the sign time applaud

Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when they tell you
They sell you
For your children
The shelter they're building
