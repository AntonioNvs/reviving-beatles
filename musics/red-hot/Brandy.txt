Brandy

To Di To Di To Di To Di

There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

There's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whisky and wine
The sailors say...

(Refrão)

Brandy, you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be, such a fine girl

Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

To Di To Di To Di To Di

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summers day - bearing gifts - from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
The harbor was his home...

(Refrão)

Brandy, you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea

To Di To Di To Di To Di

Brandy used to watch his eyes
As he told his sailor stories
he could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

To Di To Di To Di To Di

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a slient town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say...

To Di To Di To Di To Di

Brandy, you're a fine girl (You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be (such a fine girl)
But my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea
