A Teenager In Love

Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
'Cos I am so afraid
That we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll have to learn
The good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be the lonely one if you should say we're through

Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
Even you should say goodbye
I still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?

I cried a tear
For nobody but you
I be the lonely one if you should say we're through

Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
And if you say goodbye
I still go on loving you

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love?
