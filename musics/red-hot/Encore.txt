Encore

Listen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon, we got high
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space, too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut, Soviet Spy
Every now and then, when I remember to befriend the little things in life

Hey, you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

Later on I'll read to you the things that I've been needing to say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had, tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off 'fore you die
Take a little breath before you catch an early death, there is so much sky

Hey, you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

Skinny brains and little stains upon your face
Teenage remains, tell me more
Lifted in the fifties, when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now
