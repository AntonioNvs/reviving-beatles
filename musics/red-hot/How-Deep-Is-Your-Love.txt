How Deep Is Your Love

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
and the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again.

And you come to me on a summer breeze
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
and it's me you need to show
how deep is your love

(Chorus)
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
breaking us down when they all should let us be
we belong to you and me.

I believe in you
you know the door to my very soul.
you're the light in my deepest darkest hour
you're my saviour when I fall

And you may not think I care for you
when you know down inside that I really do
and it's me you need to show How deep is your love?

(Chorus)

La da da da da, la da da da da da da da da da da

And you come to me on a summer breeze
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
and it's me you need to show
how deep is your love

(Chorus)
