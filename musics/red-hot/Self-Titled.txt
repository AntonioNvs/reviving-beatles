Self-Titled

Hoo, Lord !

Well, I'm gonna drive a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills

Well, I'm gonna drive a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
Just don't show me anything
'cos that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't kill coyotes

Well, I'm gonna drive a sabertooth horse
Through the Hollywood hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust
I barbecue my meals

Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon
Through the Hollywood hills, yeah...
Huh, Hollywood hills

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies
Pale face die

True men don't kill coyotes
True men don't...
