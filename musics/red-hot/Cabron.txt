Cabron

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

I see you in the park
You're always wearing
Dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and
Anyone from any other crew

I am small but I am strong
I'll get it on with you
If you want me to
What else can I do?

Everyone would take a cue
From anything you do
If you want them to
What else can they do?

I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singin' songs
About the local news

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

I'll come around and make peace
Get down have a barbecue
Let's keep the Moon awake
And do electric boogaloo

I am small but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you

All the world would
Take a cue from
Anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you

I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singin' songs
About the local news

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

If you want me to
What else can I do?
Cause I'm just like you
If you only knew

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
