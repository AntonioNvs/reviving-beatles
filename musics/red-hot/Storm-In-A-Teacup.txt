Storm In A Teacup

Oh Good God, Heaven almighty
Heaven's to murder troy,
We've got a cataclismic situation developing
Someone get down here now!!

Come on come on baby
Let me show you what I'm talking about
You try to be a lady
But your walkin' like a sour kraut
Looka looka lika lika
Like you want to get some
If you never tell a lie
Then you never have to play dumb

Dirty baby time you're gonna take some
Pretty baby love you're make some
Little lady hearts you're gonna break some
Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some

Dirty baby we've got a situation
Pretty baby open invitaion
Little lady what a reputation
Kinda shady now you're gonna make again

I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup girl

Oh oh no its getting worse
Worse by the minute
We're down here in a divison in mystery
Someone send for back up!!

Every other day you say
You're gonna have to bury 'em
Famous last words
Spoken from the laserium
Descendants had to record
Sayin' somethin' 'bout Milo
You can take the a train
But you're gonna have to lie low

I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup girl

Dirty baby time you're gonna take some
Pretty baby love you're make some
Little lady hearts you're gonna break some
Kinda shady tears you're gonna fake some

Dirty baby we've got a situation
Pretty baby open invitaion
Little lady what a reputation
Kinda shady now you're gonna make again

I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
I know we may never get out of here
A tiny storm in your teacup girl
