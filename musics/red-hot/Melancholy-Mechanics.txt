Melancholy Mechanics

Persistant mystic faults my vision
It's like always this point of collision
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
3 pounds of grain
About to burst
Inside my 3 pound universe
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short
You know they just don't get that low
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation
Cleaner than light
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers
Of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,
Alone in the constellation of alienation
Detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait for the wave to break
