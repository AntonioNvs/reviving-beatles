Torture Me

Because I’m happy to be sad
I want it all I want it bad
Oh-oh – it’s what I know

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin’ me so torture me

All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go – it's what I know

The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill
Let’s go...

Let’s turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound
Is so...

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
It’s so...
