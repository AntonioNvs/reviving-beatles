Universally Speaking

I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still, I so admired
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me shewolf style
Rip right through me

Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her
I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight

Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her
I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run

Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her
I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Let's go
