Good Time Boys

Indeed it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel round the world, gettin' naked on the stage
Bustin' people out of their everyday cage

We like to think
We make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud
Our mammy and our pappy

Funky young kings, we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talking about my buddy, funk it up Fishbone

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day, the good time boys that might jest be president

Like a pack of mad hatters
Who come from outer space
Our swinging's going to shatter
Every stone cold face

Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Making more that money, more than money can buy
I stop! And take a listen to the monsters try

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

If you don't believe me you can ask John Doe
Because his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you about the band called fire hose

To those of you who doubt
The nature of our spirit
We play it out loud
For everyone to hear it

Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Good, good time boys
Make me feel good
Give me good times
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
