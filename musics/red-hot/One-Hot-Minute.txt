One Hot Minute

I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike

Am I all alone

She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss

Am I all alone

One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it (3x)
If I chase it I might waste it
Come and spin it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Oh maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Close your eyes
And click your heels
Can you believe
How good it feels

Am I all alone

One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it (3x)
If a chase it I might waste it
Come and spin it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Oh maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Three pounds of love
Inside my skull
A million more lives
It's never gone
Just a few times spun
Spun around the Sun
A couple more or less
And then we're done

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Oh maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
