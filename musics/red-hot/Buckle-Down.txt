Buckle Down

Hot off the ice
No hole in my soul
We’re men not mice
No stopping my role
Hot yea twist
Red star black fist
Work hard play more
Just turn me loose
I know what’s right in life
You better buckle down
Don’t give up the fight in life
You better buckle down
Trail blaze with might in life
You better buckle down
Live dreams tonight in life
You better buckle down
‘Cause I know what’s right

Hot off the ice
No hole in my soul
We’re men not mice
No stopping my role
Hot yea twist
Red star black fist
Work play more
Just turn me loose
I know what’s right in life
You better buckle down
Don’t give up the fight in life
You better buckle down
Trail blaze with might in life
Better buckle down
Live dreams tonight in life
You better buckle down
‘Cause I know what’s right

I know, I know, I know what's right
I know, I know, I know what's right
I know, I know, I know what's right
I know, I know, I know what's right
