Why Don't You Love Me

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whispered sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin' and I don'tknow why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths

I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't knowwhy...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
Take the ball...

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shue
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whispered sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin' and I don'tknow why...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths

I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't knowwhy...
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
