Can't Stop

Can't stop, addicted to the shin dig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend

Knocked out but boy you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant

White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature

I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation

This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute I'm passing out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
How about you

10 more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shin dig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend

Knocked out but boy you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Come from space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read through
