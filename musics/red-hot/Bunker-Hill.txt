Bunker Hill

She
She
She

Off the bus, onto the train
Getting all to high, gotta head on 5th and main
I look like you, I feel the same
You don't even know my name

I got this town all to myself
Well everybody's gone to the everybody shelf

Are you coming through? Do you want me to take your body?
It would be so cool to be cool with you 
I said lordy lordy

I'd run like blood into the drain
Rainin' daily, medley stays up in my brain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you even want to stay?

Are you coming through? Do you want me to take your body?
It would be so cool to be cool with you 
I said lordy lordy
Where'd you get that bruise? Do you want me to take your body?
I must still, taking your bod away

Are you coming through? Do you want me to take your body?
It would be so cool to be cool with you 
I said lordy lordy
Where'd you get that bruise? Do you want me to take your body?
I must still, taking your bod away
