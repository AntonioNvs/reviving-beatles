Soul To Squeeze

I've got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze

Well all the love from thee
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams (yeah)
Have turned to demons of greed that's me

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said, please
I'll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be, oh, yeah

Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Oh, so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh, make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction

It's bitter, baby
And it's very sweet
I'm on a rollercoaster
But I'm on my feet
Take me to the river
Let me on your shore
Well I'll be comin' back, baby
I'll be comin' back for more

Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad

I could not forget
But I will not endeavor
Simple pleasures are much better
But I won't regret it never

Where I go I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

Where I go, I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna keep you for the end of time
