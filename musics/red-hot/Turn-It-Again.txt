Turn It Again

Some of us get a little
And some a lot
We've got to make due
With what ever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around

You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
Is turning night into day

Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go
All we know
Heavy load
Start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again

I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get a beat and then
I turn it to ten

Lace boots and the
Ladies of kasakstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then aruba then the dominican

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go, all we know (two things I want to say now)
Heavy load, start to float (you make it all ok now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)

We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh

I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key
And then I turn it for free

We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling derbish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot
Doin' the astronaut

All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again

Here we go, all we know (two things I want to say now)
Heavy load, start to float (you make it all ok now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)
