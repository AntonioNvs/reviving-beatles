This Ticonderoga

I met a man in a rock and roll band
He said: Won't you come with me?
I let him know that I could not go
You see, I get mine for free

We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite

Step inside the emotional ride
I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary
I call my best friend Flea

This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown, between us there are lines

Yes, I told her that
I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day?
I would not have it any other way, well

Means so much to me
Can you see the we?
What are we ever gonna do?
When all I want to be is next to you

I took a girl from the underworld
And I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done
She was not up for the fight

We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind

It's my favorite
So I savor it
I must report that life is short
So of your love I'll take ten quarts, well

There's no end to this
Don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent
For sitting on my elephant and

Am I crazy to
Join the lazy zoo?
All these human butterflies and
Cactus flowers swollen eyes and

I want the devil's share
Of you, I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do
When all these animals want
To be just like you

I met a girl with long black hair
And she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil
And I picked her for my bride

We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right

Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
