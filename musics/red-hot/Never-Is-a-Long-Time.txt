Never Is a Long Time

If I stall at all or
Hesitate
The world of always
Never seems to wait
A comedy that could be
So divine
Never is a long time

A shadow born
To steal the light of day
You woke me up
And said, “C’mon, let’s play”
Well now I know
This never has it’s way

You are, you are
The star I say
From far from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all to stay
By you, by you
By you, by you
For you I do

I thought I’d done it all
I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked
As good as you
Now every never
That I knew was fine
Never is a long time

And now I share
This feeling with my dad
Stolen goods are not always
Half that bad
The never that we’ll always

You are, you are
The star I say
From far from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all to stay
By you, by you
By you, by you
For you I do
The faded piping on your press
Will always have its place I guess
By you, by you
A common love
That we can bless
The pleasure of
My child’s mess
Golden books
And tenderness
Have rescued me
From emptiness

You are, you are
The star I say
From far from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all to stay
You are you are
The star I say
From far, from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all, it all, it all, it all, it all to stay
