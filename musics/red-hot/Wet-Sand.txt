Wet Sand

My shadow side so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary, son, but it’s so

My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent, why do you care
Someone start the car
Time to go, you’re the best I know

My sunny side has up and died
I’m betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low

The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

My what a good day
For a walk outside
I’d like to get to know
You a little better baby
God knows that I really tried

My what a good day
For a take out bride
I’d like to say we
Did it for the better of

I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary, son, but its so

The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty
Going toe to toe

My what a good day
Just to let it slide
I’d like to say we did it for the better of

I thought about it
And I brought it out
I’m motivated by the lack of doubt
I’m consecrated, but I’m not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

Right on the verge, just one more dose
I’m traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn’t perfect, but its close

I’m almost there, why should I care
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up and
Let it show

My what a good day
For a walk outside
I’d like to think we did it for the better of

I thought about it
And I brought it out
I’m motivated by the lack of doubt
I’m consecrated, but I’m not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

You don’t form in the wet sand
You don’t form at all
You don’t form in the wet sand
I do Yeah
You don’t form in the wet sand
You don’t form at all
You don’t form in the wet sand
I do
