The Getaway

That’s right, you’re right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Take me through the future
It’s time, you’re fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture

You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let’s go, you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it to my ride

You don’t have to keep it if it’s mine
(Another lonely superstar)
(To get away inside your car)
Another place, maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside)
(A lover that another tried)

Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let’s steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner

Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no, we can’t be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it to my ride

You don’t have to keep it if it’s mine
(Another lonely superstar)
(To get away inside your car)
Another place, maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside)
(A lover that another tried)

That’s right, you’re right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It’s time, you’re fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination

Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it to my ride

A May December might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar)
(To get away inside your car)
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside)
(A lover that another tried)

Don’t be late 'cause you’re my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden Gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays
