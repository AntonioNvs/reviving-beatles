I Could Have Lied

There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I don't care, you see, so what if I bleed?

I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

A mountain never seems to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true

I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
