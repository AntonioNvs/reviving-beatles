Whatever We Want

I stole your haircut and 
Your balling personality 

The perfect pallet for 
A painting of morality 

And now I come across without 
A loss of what to be 

Add up the two of us and 
Then subtract the one of me 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 

I'll turn you into one and 
Then i'll turn you out for fun 

Older than days and age 
In fact you never were that young 

Decended from a line 
Of endless oppotunities 

I'll build a mountain will 
You bring it down and ruin it please 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 
A sweet super tiger 
Won't it be great 

We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 

We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 
We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 

I'm dreaming up the thing 
That no one ever knew was love 

I'll get your higher than the 
Hawks of Hollywood above 

It's up for grabs the ragged 
String of possibilites 

To walk away from this could 
Leave me feeling ? 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 
A sweet super tiger 
Won't it be great 

We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
We could all to 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 

We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 
We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 

Come meet your maker 
A different kind of strain 
A sweet super tiger 
Won't it be great 

We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
We could all do 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 
What ever we want 

We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to 
We could all do 
What 
Ever we want to
