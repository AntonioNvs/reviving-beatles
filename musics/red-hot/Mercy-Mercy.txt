Mercy Mercy

Mercy mercy mercy me
Look around
I need another remedy
The art of noise philosophy
Better yet
I'll let you get ahead of me

Mercy Mercy Mercy me
Come around
I need another enemy
Anyone could clearly see
The summer breeze
is part of my anatomy

When it's written in britain
We get a littlw smitten
Like a kitten
The cuddle is where I'm benetfittin'

Any higher the buyer
Would have to pacifier
Up on the wire the flyer
Is gonna satisfy her

My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Comin' down
I've got a case of gravity
Even though we disagree
Give a kiss
'Cause life could be the death of me

Acrobatic the static
Is getting to dramatic
Comin' down with the system
We're getting' systematic

Facilitating the mating
My love is circulating
Rejuvenating the fading
But never dilating

My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Mercy mercy mercy me
Lovin' on the color of an Emily
Easy as a guarantee
Better yet I'll show you
What you want to see

My love is forever
By law we can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Re-enter forever
I want you to feel this
My gentle defender
Step forward and steal this
