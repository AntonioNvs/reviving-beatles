Stone Cold Bush

She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

Get up off your knees
Come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to life
I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

Haight Street got nothing to show
Except the skirt on your ass
When you're livin' on the streets you've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Awe everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that gut
You do it oh so well

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

She's got marble eyes
Sweet china doll her thighs
And animal in pain she starts to cry
Her pipes are open wide
She blows more than my mind
Echo sounds of soul time after time

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush
