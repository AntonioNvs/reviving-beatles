I Found Out

I've told you before, stay away from my door 
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
The freaks on the phone, don't leave me alone 
don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 


I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Now that I showed you what I've been through 
Don't take nobody's word what you can do 
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
Now that I found out I know I can cry 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man 
I heard somethin' 'bout my Ma' and my Pa '
They didn't want me so they made me a star 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Oh, Hare Krishna ain'tgot nothing on you 
Just keep you crazy with nothin' to do 
Keepin' you occupied with your pie in the sky 
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all 
I've seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
Don't let them fool you with them dope and cocaine 
No one can harm you, or feel your own pain 

I, I found out! 
I, I found this out!
