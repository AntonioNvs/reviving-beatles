Animal Bar

Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of  Mr. Norman mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation

And it wont be long
No it wont be long
No it wont be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Make more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
1 2 3 lets make this
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta  feeling of worth
1 2 3 forsake this

All aboard the ship
Cause you're going to need an ark
When the wet comes down
You'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up  the stain and
I'm a little older
The song of rain
At the animal bar

And it wont be long
No it wont be long
No it wont be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation
And it wont be long
No it wont be long
No it wont be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
1 2 3 lets make this
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta  feeling of worth
1 2 3 forsake this

Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat
Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find its day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim no break this
Wash me down my station
Make more rain forsaken
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
1 2 3 lets make this
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
1 2 3 forsake this
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
1 2 3 lets make this
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
1, 2, 3, forsake this
