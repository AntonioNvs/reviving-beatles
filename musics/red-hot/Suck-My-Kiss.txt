Suck My Kiss

Yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah
Oh, yeah
Hit me

Should have been, could have been, would have been dead
If I didn't get a message goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn

Oh, baby, think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo Peep cumin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare

Oh, baby, please, be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me, you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me, please, pervert me
Stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss

Look at me, can't you see all I really want to be
Is free from a world that hurts me?
I need relief
Do you want me, girl, to be your thief?

Oh, baby, just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to

K - I - S - S - I - N - G
Chicka chicka dee, do me like a banshee
Low brow is how
Swimming in the sound of bow wow wow

Oh, baby, do me now
Do me here, I do allow

Hit me, you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me, please, pervert me
Stick with this
Is she gonna curtsy?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
That mouth was made to

Should have been, could have been, would have been dead
If I didn't get the message goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn

Oh, baby, think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo Peep cummin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare

Aw, baby, please, be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me you, can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me, please, pervert me
Stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
That mouth was made to suck my kiss
