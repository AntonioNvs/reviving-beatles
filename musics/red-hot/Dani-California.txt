Dani California

Getting born in the State of Mississippi
Papa was a copper
And mama was a hippie
In Alabama
She would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew
That there was anything more than poor
What in the world
Does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana

She’s a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin’:
Baby, watcha gonna?
Looking down the barrel
Of a hot metal 45
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
She’s a lover, baby, and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin’
When it got a little brighter

With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come
When I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded
She was stealin’ another breath
I love my baby to death

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

Push the fader
Gifted animator
One for the now
And eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man
Was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the badlands
She was savin’ the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She’s my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
