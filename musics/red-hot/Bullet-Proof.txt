Bullet Proof

All around the world
I'd rather be in a band
Playin' my funky music as loud as I can

I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain
I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain

I don't want your war
I don't like the boom and bang
I don't want to song,I don't like the songs you sing
