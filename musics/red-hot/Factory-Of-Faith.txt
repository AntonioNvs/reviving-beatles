Factory Of Faith

All my life I was
Swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple
Never playing good defense
We were gunnin’ for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there
So I couldn’t really get her

Factually I – I’m just a piece of it
Factually I – the very least of it

Piece of work
I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore
A busy mind could go berserk
Feast on this
I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip
When I opened up the book

Factually I – I’m just a piece of it
Factually I – the very least of it
Factually I – it’s just the medicine
Makes you wanna cry – why don't they let us in

Be my wife
I think you’re right that we should mate
Tell your friends
I’ve got a factory of faith
Late last night
I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends
I’ve got a factory of faith
I’ve got a factory of

Crack your whip
She’s confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there
But not as much for round trip
All this time
I was searching for a dream
I was slippin’ in and out
Of every other sex machine
