Venice Queen

Does it go from east to west yo
Body free and a body less yo
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime

Dropping in coming through the mesh yo
Checking in just to get it blessed yo
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free the roam
Where you come from?
Where you going?

Where you come from?
Where you going?

Do it all then it all again yo
Make it up and you make a friend yo
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas

Take a chance on a recommend yo
Hard as hell just to comprehend yo
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
Where you come from?
Where you going?

Where you come from?
Where you going?

We all want to tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best i've ever seen
We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best i've ever

I know you said you don't believe
In god do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend

Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend

And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of what I know?
Where would I be without you Glo
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend

I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
A kiss goodbye before you leave
G.L.O.R.I.A
Is love my friend
