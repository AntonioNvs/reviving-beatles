Catch My Death

Death
Let me catch my breath
Let me see what's left
Let me see what's true
Do I really want to
Run from my depths
Will I have regrets
Will I ever find you
Will I ever find the words
That give me motive to express

Bread
Will I go unfed
Will I be that who rushed on in
To where angels fear to tread
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
When you're leaning on love
Those greateful dead

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Chess, let me play my best
When I do regress, let it all unwind
'Cause we're never confined
To the board unless
Less a second I guess
Look into the sky where we all comply
With something higher than the
Rest my love, sail through

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Someone like you

Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I'm a child
Stayed for a while

Flesh is it meaning less
But we all protest
To the lest request
Is there anything you
Could now suggest
Did I do my best
Did I leave it better
Even though we look to be
Just  mildly obsessed with you
Sail through

Someone like you
To be there
