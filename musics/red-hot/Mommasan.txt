Mommasan

51-50 Bulletproof glass
Take away vinny play
Attempted to the past
So you shed tears that felt
The eyes the blood and the hammerhead
Something you buy and just can’t penetrate
A loss of nature that do state
Rearrange the change and recreate
A wake up song come on and levitate

Oh momma please don’t cry
I promise I won’t die
And if I stay too long
Well I will be forever in your favour
Forever always yours
Forever always

Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said
It won't be long
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said
It won’t be long

Instrumental break

The letter’s come for me to be someone
Two persons on the days I’ll be the numb one
Passion flower family
Cause I’m the one, the one and only blood son
So hard to understand
I know you loved your one and only soulman
Do you believe in one steer-in
I’ll be there; just because I can

Oh momma please don’t cry
I promise I won’t die
And if I stay too long
Well I will be forever in your favour
Forever always yours
Forever always
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come baby said
It wont be long
Momma please mommasan
Momma be mommasan momma say momma come momma said
It won’t be long
