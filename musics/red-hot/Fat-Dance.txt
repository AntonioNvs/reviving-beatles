I met her on the school yard and
She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because i acted like a bodyguard
Oh yohanna love my yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My god that i have ever seen
Tearin up my seraton and messing
With my dopamine
Oh yohanna love my yohanna love
Just about the time
That i was feeling fine again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh yohanna love my yohanna love
She knew what she was doing
When she told me no she would never... (???)
Oh yohanna love oh oh

Do a fat dance
Do a fat dance
Do a do a do a fat dance

Number three reason why i'm in your house
Hot butter melts across your mouth
Dancing and a dancing
And a dancing machine
Somebody move
Somebody scream

One reason why i got you floored
A-woman is that you can do the move-a-more
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it mooving cause i need the hardcore
I need the hardcore (x3)
