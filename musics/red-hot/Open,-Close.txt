Open, Close

So we were down in Brasil and
And that place is wild, we were in Rio de Janeiro
And we had this sort of a security guard, tough guy
And he was supposed to take us around
I said: hey could, you know, could you take us to the
The favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and
You know, the street life of your town
He said: sure so we, we pull up to this hooker and
She’s wearing some kind of a... A-a bright green mini skirt
And it turns out it’s a transexual
He says: get over here and she comes over and she thinks she’s busted.
But she’s not busted, no she’s not busted
He just wanted to smack her in the ass a few times
I and say, hey what’s up girl

I get out of bed
And I clear up my head
I don’t want to go
But I do it instead
We are dreams
Within a dream

I get into bed
And I turn off my head
I started to float
Was it something she said
We are dreams
Within a dream

So I remember we got our driver’s license
And my friend hillel had this little datsun painted green and in
Hollywood we get so crazy in the winter
The rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights and
Well you know we’d smoke weed and we’d go up in the hills
And we’d listen to progressive rock music
And just kind of trip out and
Well we were dreaming, you know, we were dreaming
And we were talking about what we wanted to do
And we were talking about girls and music and
You know, hillel wanted to be a rock star
I didn’t even know what that was and I was like:
Whatever you want to do man, I’m coming with you, I’m right with you my friend

I get out of bed
And I clear up my head
I don’t want to go
But I do it instead
We are dreams
Within a dream

I get into bed
And I turn off my head
I started to float
Was it something she said
We are dreams
Within a dream

Why in the world would you want it to be
Why would you wanna take it so, so literally
All this things that come down from the sky
Raining upon your head
Make me stop and wonder why
Can I just spell it out, make it clear
Make it easy to read
For the simple man like me?
I don’t think so
I reached out to my family and I said:
It’s not about religion and the God
Sitting in the chair in the sky
With a punishing hand, no
It’s about heaven in your heart
Now, when can we start?
I wanna choose love instead of fear
Won’t you come right now over here
And we come now
Let me make it easy this time
I love you
