Tell Me Baby

They come from every state to find
Some dreams are meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do

No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue

Come and get it, lost it at the city limits
Say goodbye cause they will find the way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute

This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's only promising
This place was made on you

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
Tell me lover, are you lonely
The thing we need is never all that hard to find out
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where do you come from and where you want to go this time on
You're so lovely, are you lonely
Or giving up on the innocence you left behind

Some claim to have the fortitude
To shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed

I move you like a baritone
Jungle brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

Chitty, chitty, baby, when your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet but life can be a little shitty
What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City
Lookin' for a hundred but you only ever found a fi'ty

Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
Tell me, lover, are you lonely
The thing we need is never all that hard to find out
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
You're so lovely, are you lonely
Or giving up on the innocence that you left behind, behind

Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
Tell me, lover, are you lonely
The thing we need is never all that hard to find out
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from and where you want to go this time on
You're so lovely, are you lonely
Or giving up on the innocence that you left behind
