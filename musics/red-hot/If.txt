If

And if I had a clue I'd know exactly what to do
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two

We could take a walk into the canyons of 5th avenue
Sing and dance, just to name a few
All I do, all I do

And if I heard the angels sing
I'd sing it back to you and bring sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown one that was a perfect fit for you

We could take a walk into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay a secret little hideway
Spend a little time inside of you

All I do, all I do
All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on you
All I do, all I do, all I do, all i do
