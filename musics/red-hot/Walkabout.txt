Walkabout

I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all bout
(and that ain't hard)

Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet

A detective of perspective I
I need to try to get a bigger eye
(open wide)

Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout, in a sunny daze
(do me now)

On a walkabout
You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in a desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout

High desert skies are what I spy
So fly - you've got to wonder why

The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear

The digirido original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigene

On a walkabout
You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkbout

A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
(one ... two)

I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about
(can't hurt to try)

Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side
