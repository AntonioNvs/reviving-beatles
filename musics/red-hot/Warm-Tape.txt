Warm Tape

Shiver for me girl
Deliver for me my darling
Pushin' up to you
A river that runs right thru you
Swim for your smile
In a blue rock quarry
Make it for me baby
You won't be sorry
Shiver for my now
Deliver for me my darling

Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the waters of love
Two of us were made of angels dust
I've been around
But not around enough

Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm

Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the waters of love
Two of us were made of angels dust
I've been around
But not around enough

Let's go
I know, I make it for two and if
Intuitions only what you take from it
I know, I make it for two and if
You were there and I was fortunate
I know, I make it for two and if
Messy bed a part of cheating
I won't fall for you
I know I make it for two
I make it for two
I make it for two and

Shiver for me now
Deliver for me my darling
A living that I could
Be giving to you my sweet love
Swim for your smile
In a blue rock quarry
Make it for me baby
You won't be sorry
Shot from the pages of
Love and glory
Sleeping next to you
And I'm in your dream

Settle for love
Settle for love
Settle for love
