Charlie

All aboard stitch in time
Get yours got mine
In a minute I'll be there
Sit tight get square

You could do it at the hippodrome
Slide back trombone
Anybody got a tv tome
That's right unknown

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little women save me some
Better get up on your run

So much more than charlie's wakin' me
To my core and charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And Charlie's makin' me
And Charlie's makin' me smile
Oh oh now

Everybody do the twist
Get the message on flea's fist
Move around like a scientist
Lay down. get kissed

Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy will advice
Eveready in disguise
Sunset sunrise

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little women save me some
Better get up on your run

So much more than Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And Charlie's makin' me
And Charlie's makin' me smile
Oh oh now

My heart Your skin
This love I'm in
We don't arrive without a suprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Belong
Intimate sight has come in to light

When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little women save me some
Better get up on your run

All I ever wanted to
Was pick it up and run with you
Slip into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell

So much more than Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And charlie's makin' me
And charlie's makin' me smile
Oh oh now

My heart your skin
This love I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right I'm wrong
Be free belong
Intimate sight has come in to light
My heart your skin
This love  I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right I'm wrong
Be free belong
Intimate sight has come in to light
