Fortune Faded

They say in chess you gotta kill the queen, and then you made it
Oh, I, do you?
A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated
Hey, now, every time I lose
Altitude

You took a town by storm, the mess you made was nominated
Oh, I, do you?
Now put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've overstayed it
Hey, now, every time I lose
Altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

The medicated state of mind you find is overrated
Oh, I, do you?
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it
Hey, now, every time I lose
Altitude

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

Come on, God, do I seem bulletproof?
Oh

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
