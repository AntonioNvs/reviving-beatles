Out Of Range

Leaving town to find the flower that I could deserve
Someone moves someones bound to get their feelings hurt
I'm loving you you're out of range
I wanted you you're out of range

As I walked out into the world I feel a sudden chill
I was bleeding pretty good onto a daffodil
I'm loving you you're out of range
Wanted to you're out of range

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya

I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times
Barely there your voice is cracking up across state lines
Loving you you're out of range
Wanted you you're out of range

Skies of ecstasy were breaking while I do believe
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks
I'm loving you you're out of range
Wanted to you're out of range

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya

I know it hurts when its taken away
I tell you that I could be leaving
Today with you or without you ok
Washed by the rain and its all gonna change

I don't want to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya

No sir not to much more than
Than to be reborn in the morning
Reborn so I can feel ya
The thorns of Bougainvillea
I feel ya
