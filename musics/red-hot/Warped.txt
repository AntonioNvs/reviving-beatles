Warped

(My tendency for dependency is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see to be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me)

So much love, so rare to dare
Afraid of ever being there
Take me home, I need repair
Take me, please, to anywhere

Descend
All the way
All the way

Descended from demented men
Struggle with the art of Zen
Please don't look too close at me
You might not like what you see

Descend
All the way
All the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there
Of being there

Craving sends me crawling, oh
Beg for mercy, does it show?
A vacancy that's full of holes
Hold me, please, I'm feeling cold

Descend
All the way
All the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there
Of being there
