This Velvet Glove

Close to my skin
I'm falling in
Someone who's been

Sittin' by the phone
I'm left alone
In another zone

John says to live
Above hell
And my will is well

No one is waiting
For me to fail
My will could sail yeah

It's such a waste to be wasted
In the first place
I want to taste the taste of
Being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun
'Cause there is one
Knows where I'm from

I care for you
I really do
I really do

Come closer now
So you can lie
Right by my side

Sittin' alone in the sun
I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Close to my skin
Someone who's been
I'm falling in

Disasters are
Just another star
Falling in my yard

John says to live
Above hell
My will is well

Long to be with
Someone to tell
I love your smell
