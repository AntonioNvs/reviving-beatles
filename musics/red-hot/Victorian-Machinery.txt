Victorian Machinery

Janey
You're my victorian machinery
(Breathe yourself to life)
Later
Your tender shape is pinning like the scenery
(Ride you like a bike)

You be the sail baby and
I'll be the rudder
We could make it all day
Untill it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will love you forever
When I heeded your call
In every heavy endeavour
I'll keep your place, ooh

Janey
Coming down the mouth, you're like a buffalo
(See it in your eyes)
Crazy
But then again, a girl could like it rough, you know
(Makes up for her size)

You be the sail baby and
I'll be the rudder
We could make it all day
Untill it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure
I will feel you forever
When I heeded your call
In every heavy endeavour
I'll keep your place
Be yourself
When I saw, yeah
You be the shack
And baby I'll be the desert
There is nothing to like
When there is nothing to measure
It's all our space, wooh

You are my victorian machinery
Nah nah nah nah nah, wooh

Janey
Make a fist and knock me on the mood again
(Leave yourself to lie)
Later
Make me feel like I want more than you again
(Rock me like the vibe)
Crazy
Sing along just like they do in Budapest
(On the other rise)

You be the shack
And baby I'll be the desert
There is nothing to like
When there is nothing to measure
It's all our space
