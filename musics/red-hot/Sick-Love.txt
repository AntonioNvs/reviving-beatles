Sick Love

Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming: You're my home
Vanity is blasted, but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there?

I don't know, but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Stick 'n move, you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it, that's for sure

Rivers get connected
So much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir?
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick, you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail, my baby, it'll be your last

I don't know, but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Rivers get connected
So much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

Rivers get connected
So much stronger than expected, well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliché

Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray
