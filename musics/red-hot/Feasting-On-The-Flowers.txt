Feasting On The Flowers

I was walking through the streets, I could not hear my best friend call
He was feeling incomplete, about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember, there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone, it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
The next dimension show me in

We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember, there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-six, a number much too small for someone's golden years

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone, it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bit my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
The next dimension show me in

You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said: Oh, don't look back, just look ahead

You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said: Oh, don't look back, just look ahead

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone, it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
