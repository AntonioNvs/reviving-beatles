Sick To Death

I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics

All by myself
Ain't got nobody else
Ain't got nobody else

I've had enough of watching scenes
Of schizophrenic, ego-centric, paranoiac, prima-donnas
I've had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians

All by myself
Ain't got nobody else
Ain't got nobody else

I should hate you
But I hate to lose you
I don't want you

I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mama's little chauvinists
I'm sick and tired of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics

All by myself
Ain't got nobody else
Ain't got nobody else

Ain't got nobody else
