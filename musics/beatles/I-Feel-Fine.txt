I Feel Fine

Baby's good to me, you know
She's happy as can be, you know
She said so
I앐 in love with her and I feel fine

Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I앐 in love with her and I feel fine

I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She압 so glad, she's telling all the world

That her baby buys her things you know
He buys her a diamond ring you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine

Baby says she's mine, you know
She tells me all the time, you know
She said so
I앐 in love with her and I feel fine

I앐 so glad that she압 my little girl
She압 so glad, she압 telling all the world

That her baby buys her things, you know
He buys her a diamond ring, you know
She said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine

Ooh
