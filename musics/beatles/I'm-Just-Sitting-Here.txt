I'm Just Sitting Here

People say I'm crazy
Doing what I'm doing
Well, they give me all kinds of warnings
To save me from ruin

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll

People say I'm lazy
Dreaming my life away
Well, they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll

No longer riding on the merry-go-round

Ah, people asks me questions lost in confusion
Well, I tell them there's no problem, only solutions

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
