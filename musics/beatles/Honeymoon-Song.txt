Honeymoon Song

I never knew that a day
Like today lay before us
I've got the Sun in my heart
And my heart's in the Sun
Skies are as bright
As your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is the ceiling
Feelings are reelings
Free as the air
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Who ever knew that we two
Could be free as we'd fancy
Fancy is free
But are we bound
To each other by love
To each other by love?
Who ever knew that we two
Could be free as we'd fancy
Fancy is free
But are we bound
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
