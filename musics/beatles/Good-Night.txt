Good Night

Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

Dreams, sweet dreams for me (dreams, sweet)
Dreams, sweet dreams for you (dreams, sweet dreams)

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the Moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight

Dreams, sweet dreams for me (dreams, sweet)
Dreams, sweet dreams for you (dreams, sweet dreams)

Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the Sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

Dreams, sweet dreams for me (dreams, sweet)
Dreams, sweet dreams for you (dreams, sweet dreams)

Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
Good night
