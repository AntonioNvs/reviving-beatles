Hello, Goodbye

You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go, go, go

Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

I say high, you say low
You say why and I say I don't know

Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello, goodbye)

Why, why, why, why, why, why do you say goodbye?
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye

Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

You say yes (I say yes)
I say no (but I may mean no)
You say stop (I can stay)
And I say go, go, go (till it's time to go)

Oh, oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello, oh, oh
Hello
