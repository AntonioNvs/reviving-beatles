Too Much Monkey Business

Running to and fro
Hard working at the mill
Never failed at the mill
There come a rotten bill
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Salesman talking to me
Trying to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it
You can pay me next week
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Blonde hair, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked and married
Get a home, settle down by the book
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Been to Yokohama, baby
Fighting in the war
Army bunk, army chow
Army clothes, army car
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need for me complaining
My objection's overruled
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be involved again
Working in the filling station
Too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the oil
Check the tires, dollar gas?
Aw too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want you by the race
Get away and leave me
