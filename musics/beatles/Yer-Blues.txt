Yer Blues

Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die!
Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why

In the morning
Wanna die!
In the evening
Wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth

I'm lonely
Wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones

Lonely
Wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl you know the reason why

The black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

Wanna die!
Yeah, wanna die!
If I ain't dead already
Girl, you know the reason why
