Jenn

So just remember the street feeds sea Queens, okay?
Shall we go then?
One, okay, you're ready?
One, two, three, four!

She asks me 'round to have a bite to eat
When I get there, she's invited the street

Jenn!

I tell her that I'd rather be alone
She gets the car and says she'll drive me home

Jenn!

Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me
Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me

She takes me home and slips on something cool
She let me kiss her where she don't as a rule

Jenn!

I tell her that I'd rather be alone
She gets the car and says she'll drive me home

Jenn!

Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me
Ah, Mater want Jenn to always love me

Jenn! Jenn!
Jenn! Jenn!
