Shine On You Crazy Diamond (parts VI-IX)

Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far

Shine on, you crazy diamond

Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there

Shine on, you crazy diamond

And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion
And shine
