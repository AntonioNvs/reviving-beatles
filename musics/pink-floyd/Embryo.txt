Embryo

All is love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sun shine through

All around I hear strange sounds
Come drifting round my ears
Dark the light and long the night
I feel my dawn is near

Warm glow, moon bloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sun shine through
